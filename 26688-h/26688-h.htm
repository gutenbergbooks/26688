<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was on a wild and gusty day, that Austin
and Brian Edwards were returning home from a
visit to their uncle, who lived at a distance of
four or five miles from their father&#8217;s dwelling,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
when the wind, which was already high, rose
suddenly; and the heavens, which had for some
hours been overclouded, grew darker, with every
appearance of an approaching storm. Brian was
for returning back; but to this Austin would by
no means consent. Austin was twelve years of
age, and Brian about two years younger. Their
brother Basil, who was not with them, had hardly
completed his sixth year.</p>

<p>The three brothers, though unlike in some
things&mdash;for Austin was daring, Brian fearful, and
Basil affectionate&mdash;very closely resembled each
other in their love of books and wonderful relations.
What one read, the other would read;
and what one had learned, the other wished to
know.</p>

<p>Louder and louder blew the wind, and darker
grew the sky, and already had a distant flash and
growling thunder announced the coming storm,
when the two brothers arrived at the rocky eminence
where, though the wood was above them,
the river rolled nearly a hundred fathoms below.
Some years before, a slip of ground had taken
place at no great distance from the spot, when a
mass of earth, amounting to well nigh half an
acre, with the oak trees that grew upon it, slid
down, all at once, towards the river. The rugged
rent occasioned by the slip of earth, the great
height of the road above the river, the rude rocks
that here and there presented themselves, and the
giant oaks of the wood frowning on the dangerous
path, gave it a character at once highly picturesque
and fearful. Austin, notwithstanding the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
loud blustering of the wind, and the remonstrance
of his brother to hasten on, made a momentary
pause to enjoy the scene.</p>

<p>In a short time the two boys had approached
the spot where a low, jutting rock of red sand-stone,
around which the roots of a large tree were
seen clinging, narrowed the path; so that there
was only the space of a few feet between the base
of the rock and an abrupt and fearful precipice.</p>

<p>Austin was looking down on the river, and
Brian was holding his cap to prevent it being
blown from his head, when, between the fitful
blasts, a loud voice, or rather a cry, was heard.
&#8220;Stop, boys, stop! come not a foot farther on
peril of your lives!&#8221; Austin and Brian stood
still, neither of them knowing whence came the
cry, nor what was the danger that threatened
them; they were, however, soon sensible of the
latter, for the rushing winds swept through the
wood with a louder roar, and, all at once, part
of the red sand-stone rock gave way with the
giant oak whose roots were wrapped round it,
when the massy ruin, with a fearful crash, fell
headlong across the path, and right over the
precipice. Brian trembled with affright, and
Austin turned pale. In another minute an active
man, somewhat in years, was seen making his
way over such parts of the fallen rock as had
lodged on the precipice. It was he who had
given the two brothers such timely notice of their
danger, and thereby saved their lives.</p>

<p>Austin was about to thank him, but hardly had
he began to speak, when the stranger stopped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
him. &#8220;Thank God, my young friends,&#8221; said he
with much emotion, &#8220;and not me; for we are all
in his hands. It is his goodness that has preserved
you.&#8221; In a little time the stranger had
led Austin and Brian, talking kindly to them
all the way, to his comfortable home, which
was at no great distance from the bottom of the
wood.</p>

<p>Scarcely had they seated themselves, when the
storm came on in full fury. As flash after flash
seemed to rend the dark clouds, the rain came
down like a deluge, and the two boys were thankful
to find themselves in so comfortable a shelter.
Brian&#8217;s attention was all taken up with the storm
while Austin was surprised to see the room all
hung round with lances, bows and arrows, quivers,
tomahawks, and other weapons of Indian warfare
together with pouches, girdles, and garments of
great beauty, such as he had never before seen.
A sight so unexpected both astonished and pleased
him, and made a deep impression on his mind.</p>

<p>It was some time before the storm had spent
its rage, so that the two brothers had some pleasant
conversation with the stranger, who talked
to them cheerfully. He did not, however, fail to
dwell much on the goodness of God in their preservation;
nor did he omit to urge on them to
read, on their return home, the first two verses of
the forty-sixth Psalm, which he said might dispose
them to look upwards with thankfulness
and confidence. Austin and Brian left the stranger,
truly grateful for the kindness which had
been shown them; and the former felt determined<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
it should not be his fault, if he did not,
before long, make another visit to the place.</p>

<p>When the boys arrived at home, they related,
in glowing colours, and with breathless haste,
the adventure which had befallen them. Brian
dwelt on the black clouds, the vivid lightning,
and the rolling thunder; while Austin described,
with startling effect, the sudden cry which had
arrested their steps near the narrow path, and the
dreadful crash of the red sand-stone rock, when
it broke over the precipice, with the big oak-tree
that grew above it. &#8220;Had we not been stopped
by the cry,&#8221; said he, &#8220;we must in another
minute have been dashed to pieces.&#8221; He then,
after recounting how kind the stranger had been
to them, entered on the subject of the Indian
weapons.</p>

<p>Though the stranger who had rendered the
boys so important a service was dressed like a
common farmer, there was that in his manner so
superior to the station he occupied, that Austin,
being ardent and somewhat romantic in his notions,
and wrought upon by the Indian weapons
and dresses he had seen, thought he must be
some important person in disguise. This belief
he intimated with considerable confidence, and
assigned several good reasons in support of his
opinion.</p>

<p>Brian reminded Austin of the two verses they
were to read; and, when the Bible was produced,
he read aloud, &#8220;God is our refuge and strength,
a very present help in trouble. Therefore will
not we fear, though the earth be removed, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
though the mountains be carried into the midst
of the sea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said Austin, &#8220;we had, indeed, a narrow
escape; for if the mountains were not carried
into the sea, the rock fell almost into the river.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the morrow, Mr. Edwards was early on his
way, to offer his best thanks, with those of Mrs.
Edwards, to the stranger who had saved the lives
of his children. He met him at the door, and
in an interview of half an hour Mr. Edwards
learned that the stranger was the son of a fur
trader; and that, after the death of his father, he
had spent several years among the Indian tribes,
resting in their wigwams, hunting with them, and
dealing in furs; but that, having met with an injury
in his dangerous calling, he had at last abandoned
that mode of life. Being fond of solitude, he had
resolved, having the means of following out his
plans, to purchase a small estate, and a few sheep;
he should then be employed in the open air, and
doubted not that opportunities would occur,
wherein he could make himself useful in the
neighbourhood. There was, also, another motive
that much influenced him in his plans. His mind
had for some time been deeply impressed with
divine things, and he yearned for that privacy
and repose, which, while it would not prevent
him from attending on God&#8217;s worship, would
allow him freely to meditate on His holy word,
which for some time had been the delight of his
heart.</p>

<p>He told Mr. Edwards, that he had lived there
for some months, and that, on entering the wood<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the day before, close by the narrow path, he perceived
by the swaying of the oak tree and moving
of the sand-stone rock, that there was every probability
of their falling: this had induced him to
give that timely warning which had been the
means, by the blessing of God, of preserving the
young lads from their danger.</p>

<p>Mr. Edwards perceived, by his conversation
and manners, that he was of respectable character;
and some letters both from missionaries and
ministers, addressed to the stranger, spoke loudly
in favour of his piety. After offering him his
best thanks, in a warm-hearted manner, and expressing
freely the pleasure it would give him, if
he could in any way act a neighbourly part in
adding to his comfort, Mr. Edwards inquired if
his children might be permitted to call at the
house, to inspect the many curiosities that were
there. This being readily assented to, Mr. Edwards
took his departure with a very favourable
impression of his new neighbour, with whom he
had so unexpectedly been made acquainted.</p>

<p>Austin and Brian were, with some impatience,
awaiting their father&#8217;s return, and when they
knew that the stranger who had saved their lives
had actually passed years among the Indians, on
the prairies and in the woods: that he had slept
in their wigwams; hunted beavers, bears, and
buffaloes with them; shared in their games;
heard their wild war-whoop, and witnessed their
battles, their delight was unbounded. Austin
took large credit for his penetration in discovering
that their new friend was not a common shepherd,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
and signified his intention of becoming thoroughly
informed of all the manners and customs of the
North American Indians.</p>

<p>Nothing could have been more agreeable to
the young people than this unlooked-for addition
to their enjoyment. They had heard of the
Esquimaux, of Negroes, Malays, New Zealanders,
Chinese, Turks, and Tartars; but very little of
the North American Indians. It was generally
agreed, as leave had been given them to call at
the stranger&#8217;s, that the sooner they did it the better.
Little Basil was to be of the party; and it would
be a difficult thing to decide which of the three
brothers looked forward to the proposed interview
with the greatest pleasure.</p>

<p>Austin, Brian, and Basil, had at different times
found abundant amusement in reading of parrots,
humming birds, and cocoa nuts; lions, tigers,
leopards, elephants, and the horned rhinoceros;
monkeys, raccoons, opossums, and sloths; mosquitoes,
lizards, snakes, and scaly crocodiles; but
these were nothing in their estimation, compared
with an account of Indians, bears, and buffaloes,
from the mouth of one who had actually lived
among them.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Austin Edwards</span> was too ardent in his pursuits
not to make the intended visit to the cottage
near the wood the continued theme of his conversation
with his brothers through the remainder of
the day; and, when he retired to rest, in his
dreams he was either wandering through the
forest defenceless, having lost his tomahawk, or
flying over the prairie on the back of a buffalo,
amid the yelling of a thousand Indians.</p>

<p>The sun was bright in the skies when the three
brothers set out on their anticipated excursion.
Austin was loud in praise of their kind preserver,
but he could not at all understand how any one,
who had been a hunter of bears and buffaloes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
could quietly settle down to lead the life of a
farmer; for his part, he would have remained a
hunter for ever. Brian thought the hunter had
acted a wise part in coming away from so many
dangers; and little Basil, not being quite able to
decide which of his two brothers was right, remained
silent.</p>

<p>As the two elder brothers wished to show Basil
the place where they stood when the oak tree and
the red sand-stone rock fell over the precipice
with a crash; and as Basil was equally desirous
to visit the spot, they went up to it. Austin
helped his little brother over the broken fragments
which still lay scattered over the narrow path.
It was a sight that would have impressed the
mind of any one; and Brian looked up with awe
to the remaining part of the rifted rock, above
which the fallen oak tree had stood. Austin
was very eloquent in his description of the sudden
voice of the stranger, of the roaring wind as it
rushed through the wood, and of the crashing tree
and falling rock. Basil showed great astonishment;
and they all descended from the commanding
height, full of the fearful adventure of the
preceding day.</p>

<p>When they were come within sight of the wood,
Brian cried out that he could see the shepherd&#8217;s
cottage; but Austin told him that he ought not to
call the cottager a shepherd, but a hunter. It was
true that he had a flock of sheep, but he kept them
more to employ his time than to get a living by
them. For many years he had lived among the
Indians, and hunted buffaloes with them; he was,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
therefore, to all intents and purposes, a buffalo
hunter, and ought not to be called a shepherd.
This important point being settled&mdash;Brian and
Basil having agreed to call him, in future, a hunter,
and not a shepherd&mdash;they walked on hastily to the
cottage.</p>

<p>In five minutes after, the hunter was showing
and explaining to his delighted young visitors the
Indian curiosities which hung around the walls
of his cottage, together with others which he kept
with greater care. These latter were principally
calumets, or peace-pipes; mocassins, or Indian
shoes; war-eagle dresses, mantles, necklaces,
shields, belts, pouches and war-clubs of superior
workmanship. There was also an Indian cradle,
and several rattles and musical instruments: these
altogether afforded the young people wondrous
entertainment. Austin wanted to know how the
Indians used their war-clubs; Brian inquired how
they smoked the peace-pipe; and little Basil was
quite as anxious in his questions about a rattle,
which he had taken up and was shaking to and
fro. To all these inquiries the hunter gave satisfactory
replies, with a promise to enter afterwards
on a more full explanation.</p>

<p>In addition to these curiosities, the young people
were shown a few specimens of different
kinds of furs: as those of the beaver, ermine,
sable, martin, fiery fox, black fox, silver fox, and
squirrel. Austin wished to know all at once,
where, and in what way these fur animals were
caught; and, with this end in view, he contrived
to get the hunter into conversation on the subject.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that you know all about
beavers, and martins, and foxes, and squirrels.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> I ought to know something about
them, having been in my time somewhat of a
<i>Voyageur</i>, a <i>Coureur des bois</i>, a <i>Trapper</i>, and a
<i>Freeman</i>; but you will hardly understand these
terms without some little explanation.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> What is a Coureur des bois?</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> What is a Voyageur?</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> I want to know what a Trapper is.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Perhaps it will be better if I give
you a short account of the way in which the furs
of different animals are obtained, and then I can
explain the terms, Voyageur, Coureur des bois,
Trapper, and Freeman, as well as a few other
things which you may like to know.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> Yes, that will be the best way.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Please not to let it be a short account,
but a long one. Begin at the very beginning,
and go on to the very end.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Well, we shall see. It has pleased
God, as we read in the first chapter of the book
of Genesis, to give man &#8220;dominion over the fish
of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over
the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every
creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.&#8221; The
meaning of which is, no doubt, not that he may
cruelly abuse them, but that he may use them for
his wants and comforts, or destroy them when
they annoy and injure him. The skins of animals
have been used as clothing for thousands of years;
and furs have become so general in dresses and
ornaments, that, to obtain them, a regular trade<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
has long been carried on. In this traffic, the uncivilized
inhabitants of cold countries exchange
their furs for useful articles and comforts and
luxuries, which are only to be obtained from
warmer climes and civilized people.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> And where do furs come from?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Furs are usually obtained in cold
countries. The ermine and the sable are procured
in the northern parts of Europe and Asia; but most
of the furs in use come from the northern region
of our own country.</p>

<p>If you look at the map of North America, you
will find that between the Atlantic and the Pacific
Oceans the space is, in its greatest breath, more
than three thousand miles; and, from north to
south, the country stretches out, to say the least
of it, a thousand miles still further. The principal
rivers of North America are the Mackenzie,
Missouri, Mississippi, Ohio, and St. Lawrence.
The Mississippi is between three and four thousand
miles long. Our country abounds with lakes,
too: Ontario and Winipeg are each near two
hundred miles long; Lakes Huron and Erie are
between two and three hundred; Michigan is four
hundred, and Lake Superior nearly five hundred
miles long.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> What a length for a lake! nearly five
hundred miles! Why, it is more like a sea than
a lake.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Well, over a great part of the space
that I have mentioned, furry animals abound; and
different fur companies send those in their employ
to boat up the river, to sail through the lakes, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
hunt wild animals, to trap beavers, and to trade
with the various Indian tribes which are scattered
throughout this extensive territory.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Oh! how I should like to hunt and
to trade with the Indians!</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Better think the matter over a little
before you set off on such an expedition. Are
you ready to sail by ship, steam-boat, and canoe,
to ride on horseback, or to trudge on foot, as the
case may require; to swim across brooks and
rivers; to wade through bogs, and swamps, and
quagmires; to live for weeks on flesh, without
bread or salt to it; to lie on the cold ground; to
cook your own food; and to mend your own
jacket and mocassins? Are you ready to endure
hunger and thirst, heat and cold, rain and solitude?
Have you patience to bear the stings of tormenting
mosquitoes; and courage to defend your life
against the grizzly bear, the buffalo, and the tomahawk
of the red man, should he turn out to be
an enemy?</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> No, no, Austin. You must not think
of running into such dangers.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> I will now give you a short account
of the fur trade. About two hundred years ago,
or more, the French made a settlement in Canada,
and they soon found such advantage in obtaining
the furry skins of the various animals wandering
in the woods and plains around them, that, after
taking all they could themselves, they began to
trade with the Indians, the original inhabitants of
the country, who brought from great distances
skins of various kinds. In a rude camp, formed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
of the bark of trees, these red men assembled,
seated themselves in half circles, smoked their
pipes, made speeches, gave and received presents,
and traded with the French people for their skins.
The articles given in exchange to the Indian hunters,
were knives, axes, arms, kettles, blankets,
and cloth: the brighter the colour of the cloth,
the better the Indians were pleased.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> I think I can see them now.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> Did they smoke such pipes as we have
been looking at?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Yes; for almost all the pipes used by
the red men are made of red stone, dug out of
the same quarry, called pipe-stone quarry; about
which I will tell you some other time. One bad
part of this trading system was, that the French
gave the Indians but a small part of the value of
their skins; and besides this they charged their own
articles extravagantly high; and a still worse feature
in the case was, that they supplied the Indians
with spirituous liquors, and thus brought upon
them all the evils and horrors of intemperance.</p>

<p>This system of obtaining furs was carried on
for many years, when another practice sprang up.
Such white men as had accompanied the Indians
in hunting, and made themselves acquainted with
the country, would paddle up the rivers in canoes,
with a few arms and provisions, and hunt for
themselves. They were absent sometimes for as
much as a year, or a year and a half, and then
returned with their canoes laden with rich furs.
These white men were what I called <i>Coureurs
des bois</i>, rangers of the woods.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Ah! I should like to be a coureur
des bois.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Some of these coureurs des bois became
very lawless and depraved in their habits,
so that the French government enacted a law
whereby no one, on pain of death, could trade in
the interior of the country with the Indians, without
a license. Military posts were also established,
to protect the trade. In process of time, too,
fur companies were established; and men, called
<i>Voyageurs</i>, or canoe men, were employed, expressly
to attend to the canoes carrying supplies
up the rivers, or bringing back cargoes of furs.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> Now we know what a <i>Voyageur</i> is.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> You would hardly know me, were you
to see me dressed as a voyageur. Just think: I
should have on a striped cotton shirt, cloth trousers,
a loose coat made of a blanket, with perhaps
leathern leggins, and deer-skin mocassins; and
then I must not forget my coloured worsted belt,
my knife and tobacco pouch.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> What a figure you would cut! And
yet, I dare say, such a dress is best for a
voyageur.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Most of the Canadian voyageurs were
good-humoured, light-hearted men, who always
sang a lively strain as they dipped their oars into
the waters of the lake or rolling river; but steam-boats
are now introduced, so that the voyageurs
are but few.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> What a pity! I like those voyageurs.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The voyageurs, who were out for a
long period, and navigated the interior of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
country, were called <i>North-men</i>, or <i>Winterers</i>,
while the others had the name of <i>Goers and
Comers</i>. Any part of a river where they could
not row a laden canoe, on account of the rapid
stream, they called a <i>D&eacute;charge</i>; and there the
goods were taken from the boats, and carried on
their shoulders, while others towed the canoes up
the stream: but a fall of water, where they were
obliged not only to carry the goods, but also to
drag the canoes on land up to the higher level,
they called a <i>Portage</i>.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> We shall not forget the North-men,
and Comers and Goers, nor the D&eacute;charges and
Portages.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> You have not told us what a Trapper is.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> A <i>Trapper</i> is a beaver hunter. Those
who hunt beavers and other animals, for any of
the fur companies, are called Trappers; but such
as hunt for themselves take the name of <i>Freemen</i>.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Yes, I shall remember. Please to tell
us how they hunt the beavers.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Beavers build themselves houses on
the banks of creeks or small rivers, with mud,
sticks, and stones, and afterwards cover them
over with a coat of mud, which becomes very
hard. These houses are five or six feet thick at
the top; and in one house four old beavers, and
six or eight young ones, often live together. But,
besides their houses, the beavers take care to have
a number of holes in the banks, under water,
called <i>washes</i>, into which they can run for shelter,
should their houses be attacked. It is the business
of the trappers to find out all these washes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
or holes; and this they do in winter, by knocking
against the ice, and judging by the sound whether
it is a hole. Over every hole they cut out a
piece of ice, big enough to get at the beaver.
No sooner is the beaver-house attacked, than the
animals run into their holes, the entrances of
which are directly blocked up with stakes. The
trappers then either take them through the holes
with their hands, or haul them out with hooks
fastened to the end of a pole or stick.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illo024.jpg" width="400" height="279" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p><i>Austin.</i> But why is a beaver hunter called a
trapper? I cannot understand that.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Because beavers are caught in great
numbers in steel traps, which are set and baited
on purpose for them.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> Why do they not catch them in the
summer?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The fur of the beaver is in its prime
in the winter; in the summer, it is of inferior
quality.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Do the trappers catch many beavers?
I should think there could not be very many of
them.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> In one year, the Hudson&#8217;s Bay Company
alone sold as many as sixty thousand beaver-skins;
and it is not a very easy matter to
take them, I can assure you.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Sixty thousand! I did not think there
were so many beavers in the world.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> I will tell you an anecdote, by which
you will see that hunters and trappers have need
to be men of courage and activity. A trapper, of
the name of Cannon, had just had the good fortune
to kill a buffalo; and, as he was at a considerable
distance from his camp, he cut out the
tongue and some of the choice bits, made them
into a parcel, and slinging them on his shoulders
by a strap passed round his forehead, as the
voyageurs carry packages of goods, set out on
his way to the camp. In passing through a narrow
ravine, he heard a noise behind him, and
looking round, beheld, to his dismay, a grizzly
bear in full pursuit, apparently attracted by the
scent of the meat. Cannon had heard so much
of the strength and ferocity of this fierce animal,
that he never attempted to fire, but slipping the
strap from his forehead, let go the buffalo meat,
and ran for his life. The bear did not stop to regale
himself with the game, but kept on after the
hunter. He had nearly overtaken him, when
Cannon reached a tree, and throwing down his
rifle, climbed up into it. The next instant Bruin
was at the foot of the tree, but as this species of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
bear does not climb, he contented himself with
turning the chase into a blockade. Night came
on. In the darkness, Cannon could not perceive
whether or not the enemy maintained his station;
but his fears pictured him rigorously mounting
guard. He passed the night, therefore, in the
tree, a prey to dismal fancies. In the morning
the bear was gone. Cannon warily descended
the tree, picked up his gun, and made the best
of his way back to the camp, without venturing
to look after his buffalo-meat.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Then the grizzly bear did not hurt
him, after all.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> I would not go among those grizzly
bears for all in the world.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Do the hunters take deer as well as
other animals?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Deer, though their skins are not so
valuable as many furs, are very useful to hunters
and trappers; for they not only add to their stock
of peltries, but also supply them with food.
When skins have been tanned on the inside, they
are called <i>furs</i>; but, before they are tanned,
they are called <i>peltries</i>. Deer are trapped much
in the same way as buffaloes are. A large circle
is enclosed with twisted trees and brushwood,
with a very narrow opening, in the neighbourhood
of a well-frequented deer path. The inside of
the circle is crowded with small hedges, in the
openings of which are set snares of twisted
thongs, made fast at one end to a neighbouring
tree. Two lines of small trees are set up, branching
off outwardly from the narrow entrance of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
circle; so that the further the lines of trees extend
from the circle, the wider is the space between
them. As soon as the deer are seen moving in
the direction of the circle, the hunters get behind
them, and urge them on by loud shouts. The
deer, mistaking the lines of trees set up for enemies,
fly straight forward, till they enter the snare
prepared for them. The circle is then surrounded,
to prevent their quitting it, while some of the
hunters go into it, blocking up the entrance, and
kill the deer with their bows and arrows, and
their spears.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> I am sorry for the poor deer.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> And so am I, Basil.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Hunters are often obliged to leave food
in particular places, in case they should be destitute
on their return that way. They sometimes,
too, leave property behind them, and for this purpose
they form a <i>cache</i>.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> What is a <i>cache</i>?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> A <i>cache</i> is a hole, or place of concealment;
and when any thing is put in it, great care
is required to conceal it from enemies, and indeed
from wild animals, such as wolves and bears.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Well! but if they dig a deep hole, and
put the things in it, how could anybody find it?
A wolf and a bear would never find it out.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Perhaps not; unless they should
smell it.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Ay! I forgot that. I must understand
a little more of my business before I set up for a
hunter, or a trapper; but please to tell us all
about a cache.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> A cache is usually dug near a stream,
that the earth taken out of the hole may be thrown
into the running water, otherwise it would tell
tales. Then the hunters spread blankets, or what
clothes they have, over the surrounding ground,
to prevent the marks of their feet being seen.
When they have dug the hole they line it with
dry grass, and sticks, and bark, and sometimes
with a dry skin. After the things to be hidden
are put in, they are covered with another dry
skin, and the hole is filled up with grass, stones,
and sticks, and trodden down hard, to prevent the
top from sinking afterwards: the place is sprinkled
with water to take away the scent; and the turf,
which was first cut away, before the hole was dug,
is laid down with care, just as it was before it
was touched. They then take up their blankets
and clothes, and leave the cache, putting a mark
at some distance, that when they come again they
may know where to find it.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Capital! I could make a cache now,
that neither bear, nor wolf, nor Indian could find.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> But if the bear did not find the cache,
he might find you; and then what would become
of you?</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Why I would climb a tree, as Cannon
did.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Most of the furs that are taken find their
way to London; but every year the animals which
produce them become fewer. Besides the skins of
larger animals, the furs of a great number of
smaller creatures are valuable; and these, varying
in their habits, require to be taken in a different<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
manner. The bison is found on the prairies, or
plains; the beaver, on creeks and rivers; the
badger, the fox, and the rabbit, burrow in the
ground; and the bear, the deer, the mink, the
martin, the raccoon, the lynx, the hare, the musk-rat,
the squirrel, and ermine, are all to be found
in the woods. In paddling up the rivers in
canoes, and in roaming through the woods and
prairies, in search of these animals, I have mingled
much with Indians of different tribes; and if you
can, now and then, make a call on me, you will
perhaps be entertained in hearing what I can tell
you about them. The Indians should be regarded
by us as brothers. We ought to feel interested in
their welfare here, and in their happiness hereafter.
The fact that we are living on lands once
the residence of these roaming tribes, and that they
have been driven far into the wilderness to make
room for us, should lead us not only to feel sympathy
for the poor Indians, but to make decided
efforts for their improvement. Our missionary
societies are aiming at this great object, but far
greater efforts are necessary. We have the word
of God, and Christian Sabbaths, and Christian
ministers, and religious ordinances, in abundance,
to direct and comfort us; but they are but scantily
supplied with these advantages. Let us not forget
to ask in our prayers, that the Father of
mercies may make known his mercy to them,
opening their eyes, and influencing their hearts,
so that they may become true servants of the
Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>The delight visible in the sparkling eyes of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
young people, as they took their leave, spoke
their thanks. On their way home, they talked
of nothing else but fur companies, lakes, rivers,
prairies, and rocky mountains; buffaloes, wolves,
bears, and beavers; and it was quite as much as
Brian and Basil could do, to persuade their brother
Austin from making up his mind at once to be a
voyageur, a coureur des bois, or a trapper. The
more they were against it, so much the more his
heart seemed set upon the enterprise; and the
wilder they made the buffaloes that would attack
him, and the bears and wolves that would tear
him to pieces, the bolder and more courageous
he became. However, though on this point they
could not agree, they were all unanimous in their
determination to make another visit the first opportunity.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next time the three brothers did not go
to the red sand-stone rock, but the adventure
which took place there formed a part of their conversation.
They found the hunter at home, and,
feeling now on very friendly and familiar terms
with him, they entered at once on the subject
that was nearest their hearts. &#8220;Tell us, if you
please,&#8221; said Austin, as soon as they were seated,
&#8220;about the very beginning of the red men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are asking me to do that,&#8221; replied the
hunter, &#8220;which is much more difficult than you
suppose. To account for the existence of the
original inhabitants, and of the various tribes
of Indians which are now scattered throughout
the whole of North America, has puzzled the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
heads of the wisest men for ages; and, even at the
present day, though travellers have endeavoured
to throw light on this subject, it still remains a
mystery.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> But what is it that is so mysterious?
What is it that wise men and travellers cannot
make out?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> They cannot make out how it is, that the
whole of America&mdash;taking in, as it does, some parts
which are almost always covered with snow, and
other parts that are as hot as the sun can make them&mdash;should
be peopled with a class of human beings
distinct from all others in the world&mdash;red men,
who have black hair, and no beards. If you remember,
it is said, in the first chapter of Genesis,
&#8220;So God created man in his own image, in the
image of God created he him; male and female
created he them.&#8221; And, in the second chapter,
&#8220;And the Lord God planted a garden eastward
in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had
formed.&#8221; Now, it is known, by the names
of the rivers which are mentioned in the chapter,
that the garden of Eden was in Asia; so that you
see our first parents, whence the whole of mankind
have sprung, dwelt in Asia.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Yes, that is quite plain.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Well, then, you recollect, I dare say,
that when the world was drowned, all mankind
were destroyed, except Noah and his family in
the ark.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> Yes; we recollect that very well.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> And when the ark rested, it rested on
Mount Ararat, which is in Asia also. If you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
look on the map of the world, you will see that
the three continents, Europe, Asia, and Africa,
are united together; but America stands by itself,
with an ocean rolling on each side of it,
thousands of miles broad. It is easy to suppose
that mankind would spread over the continents
that are close together, but difficult to account for
their passing over the ocean, at a time when the
arts of ship-building and navigation were so little
understood.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> They must have gone in a ship, that
is certain.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> But suppose they did, how came it
about that they should be so very different from
all other men? America was only discovered
about four hundred years ago, and then it was well
peopled with red men. Besides, there have been
discovered throughout our country, monuments,
ruins, and sites of ancient towns, with thousands
of enclosures and fortifications. Articles, too, of
pottery, sculpture, glass, and copper, have been
found at times, sixty or eighty feet under the
ground, and, in some instances, with forests
growing over them, so that they must have been
very ancient. The people who built these fortifications
and towers, and possessed these articles
in pottery, sculpture, glass, and copper, lived at
a remote period, and must have been, to a considerable
degree, cultivated. Who these people
were, and how they came to America, no one
knows, though many have expressed their opinions.
But, even if we did know who they
were, how could we account for the present race<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
of Indians in North America being barbarous,
when their ancestors were so highly civilized?
These are difficulties which, as I said, have puzzled
the wisest heads for ages.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> What do wise men and travellers say
about these things?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Some think, that as the frozen regions
of Asia, in one part, are so near the frozen regions
of North America&mdash;it being only about forty miles
across Behring&#8217;s Straits&mdash;some persons from Asia
might have crossed over there, and peopled the
country; or that North America might have once
been joined to Asia, though it is not so now; or
that, in ancient times, some persons might have
drifted, or been blown there by accident, in boats
or ships, across the wide ocean. Some think
these people might have been Phenicians, Carthagenians,
Hebrews, or Egyptians; while another
class of reasoners suppose them to have been
Hindoos, Chinese, Tartars, Malays, or others. It
seems, however, to be God&#8217;s will often to humble
the pride of his creatures, by baffling their conjectures,
and hedging up their opinions with
difficulties. His way is in the sea, and his path
in the great waters, and his footsteps are not
known. He &#8220;maketh the earth empty, and
maketh it waste, and turneth it upside down, and
scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Well, if you cannot tell us of the
Indians in former times, you can tell us of the
Indians that there are, for that will be a great
deal better.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> Yes, that it will.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> You must bear in mind, that some
years have passed since I was hunting and trapping
in the woods and prairies, and that many
changes have taken place since then among the
Indians. Some have been tomahawked by the
hands of the stronger tribes; some have given up
their lands to the whites, and retired to the west
of the Mississippi; and thousands have been carried
off by disease, which has made sad havoc
among them. I must, therefore, speak of them
as they were. Some of the tribes, since I left
them, have been utterly destroyed; not one living
creature among them being left to speak of those
who have gone before them.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> What a pity! They want some good
doctors among them, and then diseases would not
carry them off in that way.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> I will not pretend to give you an exact
account of the number of the different tribes, or
the particular places they now occupy; for though
my information may be generally right, yet the
changes which have taken place are many.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Please to tell us what you remember,
and what you know; and that will quite satisfy us.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> A traveller<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> among the Indian tribes
has published a book called &#8220;Letters and Notes
on the Manners, Customs, and Condition of the
North American Indians;&#8221; and a most interesting
and entertaining account it is. If ever you can
lay hold of it, it will afford you great amusement.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>Perhaps no man who has written on the Indians
has seen so much of them as he has.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Mr. Catlin</p></div>

<p><i>Brian.</i> Did you ever meet Catlin?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> O yes, many times; and a most agreeable
companion I found him. He has lectured
in most of our cities, and shown the beautiful
collection of Indian dresses and curiosities collected
during his visits to the remotest tribes.
If you can get a sight of his book, you will soon
see that he is a man of much knowledge, and
possessing great courage, energy, and perseverance.
I will now, then, begin my narrative;
and if you can find pleasure in hearing a description
of the Indians, with their villages, wigwams,
war-whoops, and warriors; their manners, customs,
and superstitions; their dress, ornaments, and
arms; their mysteries, games, huntings, dances,
war-councils, speeches, battles, and burials; with
a fair sprinkling of prairie dogs, and wild horses;
wolves, beavers, grizzly bears, and mad buffaloes;
I will do my best to give you gratification.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> These are the very things that we want
to know.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> I shall not forget to tell you what the
missionaries have done among the Indians; but
that must be towards the latter end of my account.
Let me first show you a complete table of the
number and names of the tribes. It is in the Report
made to Congress by the Commissioners of
Indian Affairs for 1843-4.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> And now, place before you a map of
North America. See how it stretches out north
and south from Baffin&#8217;s Bay to the Gulf of Mexico,
and east and west from the Atlantic to the
Pacific Ocean. What a wonderful work of the
Almighty is the rolling deep! &#8220;The sea is His,
and he made it: and his hands formed the dry
land.&#8221; Here are the great Lakes Superior, Michigan,
Huron, Erie, and Ontario; and here run the
mighty rivers, the Mississippi, the Missouri, the
Ohio, and the St. Lawrence: the Mississippi
itself is between three and four thousand miles
long.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> What a river! Please to tell us what
are all those little hills running along there, one
above another, from top to bottom.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> They are the Rocky Mountains. Some
regard them as a continuation of the Andes of
South America; so that, if both are put together,
they will make a chain of mountains little short
of nine thousand miles long. North America,
with its mighty lakes, rivers, and mountains, its
extended valleys and prairies, its bluffs, caverns,
and cataracts, and, more than all, its Indian inhabitants,
beavers, buffaloes, and bisons, will
afford us something to talk of for some time to
come; but the moment you are tired of my account,
we will stop.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> We shall never be tired; no, not if
you go on telling us something every time we
come, for a whole year. But do tell us, how did
these tribes behave to you, when you were among
them?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> I have not a word of complaint to
make. The Indians have been represented as
treacherous, dishonest, reserved, and sour in their
disposition; but, instead of this, I have found
them generally, though not in all cases, frank, upright,
hospitable, light-hearted, and friendly.
Those who have seen Indians smarting under
wrongs, and deprived, by deceit and force, of
their lands, hunting-grounds, and the graves of
their fathers, may have found them otherwise:
and no wonder; the worm that is trodden on will
writhe; and man, unrestrained by Divine grace,
when treated with injustice and cruelty, will turn
on his oppressor.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Say what you will, I like the Indians.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> That there is much of evil among
Indians is certain; much of ignorance, unrestrained
passions, cruelty, and revenge: but they have
been misrepresented in many things. I had better
tell you the names of some of the chiefs of the
tribes, or of some of the most remarkable men
among them.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Yes; you cannot do better. Tell us
the names of all the chiefs, and the warriors, and
the conjurors, and all about them.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The Blackfeet Indians are a very warlike
people; <i>Stu-mick-o-s&uacute;cks</i> was the name of
their chief.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Stu-mick-o-s&uacute;cks! What a name! Is
there any meaning in it?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> O yes. It means, &#8220;the back fat of
the buffalo;&#8221; and if you had seen him and <i>Peh-t&oacute;-pe-kiss</i>,
&#8220;the ribs of the eagle,&#8221; another chief<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
dressed up in their splendid mantles, buffaloes&#8217;
horns, ermine tails, and scalp-locks, you would
not soon have turned your eyes from them.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> Who would ever be called by such a
name as that? The back fat of the buffalo!</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The Camanchees are famous on horseback.
There is no tribe among the Indians that
can come up to them, to my mind, in the management
of a horse, and the use of the lance: they
are capital hunters. The name of their chief is
<i>E&eacute;-shah-k&oacute;-nee</i>, or &#8220;the bow and quiver.&#8221; I
hardly ever saw a larger man among the Indians
than <i>Ta-w&aacute;h-que-nah</i>, the second chief in power.
Ta-w&aacute;h-que-nah means &#8220;the mountain of rocks,&#8221;
a very fit name for a huge Indian living near the
Rocky Mountains. When I saw <i>Kots-o-k&oacute;-ro-k&oacute;</i>,
or &#8220;the hair of the bull&#8217;s neck,&#8221; (who is, if I remember
right, the third chief,) he had a gun in
his right hand, and his warlike shield on his left
arm.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> If I go among the Indians, I shall
stay a long time with the Camanchees; and then
I shall, perhaps, become one of the most skilful
horsemen, and one of the best hunters in the
world.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> And suppose you get thrown off your
horse, or killed in hunting buffaloes, what shall
you say to it then?</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Oh, very little, if I get killed; but
no fear of that. I shall mind what I am about.
Tell us who is the head of the Sioux?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> When I was at the upper waters of
the Mississippi and Missouri rivers, <i>Ha-w&oacute;n-je-tah</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
or &#8220;the one horn,&#8221; was chief; but since then,
being out among the buffaloes, a buffalo bull attacked
and killed him.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> There, Austin! If an Indian chief was
killed by a buffalo, what should <i>you</i> do among
them? Why they would toss you over their
heads like a shuttlecock.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> <i>Wee-t&aacute;-ra-sha-ro</i>, the head chief of
the Pawnee Picts, is dead now, I dare say; for
he was a very old, as well as a very venerable
looking man. Many a buffalo hunt with the Camanchees
had he in his day, and many a time did
he go forth with them in their war-parties. He
had a celebrated brave of the name of <i>Ah&#8242;-sho-cole</i>,
or &#8220;rotten foot,&#8221; and another called <i>Ah&#8242;-re-kah-na-c&oacute;-chee</i>,
&#8220;the mad elk.&#8221; Indians give the
name of <i>brave</i> to a warrior who has distinguished
himself by feats of valour, such as admit him to
their rank.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> I wonder that they should choose
such long names. It must be a hard matter to remember
them.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> There were many famous men among
the Sacs. <i>Kee-o-kuk</i> was the chief. Kee-o-kuk
means &#8220;the running fox.&#8221; One of his boldest
braves was <i>M&aacute;-ka-tai-me-she-ki&aacute;-ki&aacute;k</i>, &#8220;the
black hawk.&#8221; The history of this renowned
warrior is very curious. It was taken down from
his own lips, and has been published. If you
should like to listen to the adventures of Black
Hawk, I will relate them to you some day, when
you have time to hear them, as well as those of
young Nik-ka-no-chee, a Seminole.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> We will not forget to remind you of
your promise. It will be capital to listen to these
histories.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> When I saw <i>Wa-s&aacute;w-me-saw</i>, or &#8220;the
roaring thunder,&#8221; the youngest son of Black
Hawk, he was in captivity. <i>N&aacute;h-se-&uacute;s-kuk</i>, &#8220;the
whirling thunder,&#8221; his eldest son, was a fine looking
man, beautifully formed, with a spirit like that
of a lion. There was a war called The Black
Hawk war, and Black Hawk was the leader and
conductor of it; and one of his most famous warriors
was <i>Wah-pe-k&eacute;e-suck</i>, or &#8220;white cloud;&#8221; he
was, however, as often called The Prophet as the
White Cloud. <i>Pam-a-h&oacute;</i>, &#8220;the swimmer;&#8221; <i>Wah-pa-ko-l&aacute;s-kak</i>,
&#8220;the track of the bear;&#8221; and <i>Pash-ce-pa-h&oacute;</i>,
&#8220;the little stabbing chief;&#8221; were, I think,
all three of them warriors of Black Hawk.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> The Little Stabbing Chief! He must
be a very dangerous fellow to go near, if we may
judge by his name: keep away from him, Austin,
if you go to the Sacs.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Oh! he would never think of stabbing
me. I should behave well to all the tribes,
and then I dare say they would all of them behave
well to me. You have not said any thing of
the Crow Indians.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> I forget who was at the head of the
Crows, though I well remember several of the
warriors among them. They were tall, well-proportioned,
and dressed with a great deal of taste
and care. <i>Pa-ris-ka-ro&oacute;-pa</i>, called &#8220;the two
crows,&#8221; had a head of hair that swept the ground
after him as he walked along.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> What do you think of that, Basil?
No doubt the Crows are fine fellows. Please to
mention two or three more.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Let me see; there was <i>E&eacute;-he&eacute;-a-duck-ch&eacute;e-a</i>,
or &#8220;he who binds his hair before;&#8221; and
<i>H&oacute;-ra-to-ah</i>, &#8220;a warrior;&#8221; and <i>Chah-ee-ch&oacute;pes</i>,
&#8220;the four wolves;&#8221; the hair of these was as long
as that of Pa-ris-ka-ro&oacute;-pa. Though they were
very tall, E&eacute;-he&eacute;-a-duck-ch&eacute;e-a being at least six
feet high, the hair of each of them reached and
rested on the ground.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> When I go among the Indians, the
Crows shall not be forgotten by me. I shall have
plenty to tell you of, Brian, when I come back.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> Yes, if you ever do come back; but
what with the sea, and the rivers, and the swamps,
and the bears, and the buffaloes, you are sure to
get killed. You will never tell us about the
Crows, or about any thing else.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> There was one of the Crows called
The Red Bear, or <i>Duhk-pits-o-h&oacute;-shee</i>.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> Duhk-pitch a&mdash;Duck pits&mdash;I cannot
pronounce the word&mdash;why that is worse to speak
than any.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Hear me pronounce it then: <i>Duhk-pits-o-hoot-shee</i>.
No; that is not quite right, but very
near it.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> You must not go among the Crows yet,
Austin; you cannot talk well enough.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Oh, there are much harder names
among some of the tribes than those I have mentioned;
for instance there is <i>A&uacute;-nah-kwet-to-hau-p&aacute;y-o</i>,
&#8220;the one sitting in the clouds;&#8221; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
<i>Eh-tohk-pay-she-pe&eacute;-shah</i>, &#8220;the black mocassin;&#8221;
and <i>Kay-&eacute;e-qua-da-k&uacute;m-&eacute;e-gish-kum</i>, &#8220;he who
tries the ground with his foot;&#8221; and <i>Mah-to-rah-rish-nee-&eacute;eh-&eacute;e-rah</i>, &#8220;the grizzly bear that runs
without fear.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> Why these names are as long as from
here to yonder. Set to work, Austin! set to work!
For, if there are many such names as these
among the Indians, you will have enough to do
without going to a buffalo hunt.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> I never dreamed that there were such
names as those in the world.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> Ay, you will have enough of them,
Austin, if you go abroad. You will never be
able to learn them, do what you will. Give it
up, Austin; give it up at once.</p>

<p>Though Brian and Basil were very hard on
Austin on their way home, about the long names
of the Indians, and the impossibility of his ever
being able to learn them by heart, Austin defended
himself stoutly. &#8220;Very likely,&#8221; said he, &#8220;after
all, they call these long names very short, just as
we do; Nat for Nathaniel, Kit for Christopher,
and Elic for Alexander.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was not long before Austin, Brian, and
Basil were again listening to the interesting accounts
given by their friend, the hunter; and it
would have been a difficult point to decide whether
the listeners or the narrator derived most pleasure
from their occupation. Austin began without
delay to speak of the aborigines of North America.</p>

<p>&#8220;We want to know,&#8221; said he, &#8220;a little more
about what these people were, and when they
were first found out.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> When America was first discovered,
the inhabitants, though for the most part partaking
of one general character, were not without variety.
The greater part, as I told you, were, both in hot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and cold latitudes, red men with black hair, and
without beards. They, perhaps, might have been
divided into four parts: the Mexicans and Peruvians,
who were, to a considerable extent, civilized;
the Caribs, who inhabited the fertile soil
and luxuriant clime of the West Indies; the Esquimaux,
who were then just the same people as
they are now, living in the same manner by
fishing; and the Red Men, or North American
Indians.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Then the Esquimaux are not Red
Indians.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> No; they are more like the people
who live in Lapland, and in the North of Asia;
and for this reason, and because the distance
across Behring&#8217;s Straits is so short, it is thought
they came from Asia, and are a part of the same
people. The red men are, however, different;
and as we agreed that I should tell you about the
present race of them, perhaps I may as well proceed.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Yes. Please to tell us first of their
wigwams, and their villages, and how they live.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> And what they eat, and what clothes
they wear.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> And how they talk to one another.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Yes; and all about their spears and
tomahawks.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The wigwams of the Indians are of
different kinds: some are extremely simple, being
formed of high sticks or poles, covered with turf
or the bark of trees; while others are very handsome.
The Sioux, the Blackfeet, and the Crows,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
form their wigwams nearly in the same manner;
that is, by sewing together the skins of buffaloes,
after properly dressing them, and making them
into the form of a tent. This covering is then
supported by poles. The tent has a hole at the
top, to let out the smoke, and to let in the light.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Ay, that is a better way of making a
wigwam than covering over sticks with turf.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The wigwams, or lodges, of the Mandans
are round. A circular foundation is dug
about two feet deep; timbers six feet high are set
up all around it, and on these are placed other
long timbers, slanting inwards, and fastened together
in the middle, like a tent, leaving space for
light and for the smoke to pass. This tent-like roof
is supported by beams and upright posts, and it is
covered over outwardly by willow boughs and a
thick coating of earth; then comes the last covering
of hard tough clay. The sun bakes this, and
long use makes it solid. The outside of a Mandan
lodge is almost as useful as the inside; for there
the people sit, stand, walk, and take the air.
These lodges are forty, fifty, or sixty feet wide.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> The Mandan wigwam is the best of all.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Wigwams, like those of the Mandans,
which are always in the same place, and are not
intended to be removed, are more substantial than
such as may be erected and taken down at pleasure.
Some of the wigwams of the Crow Indians,
covered as they are with skins dressed almost
white, and ornamented with paint, porcupine
quills and scalp-locks, are very beautiful.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Yes; they must look even better than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
the Mandan lodges, and they can be taken down
and carried away.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> It would surprise you to witness the
manner in which an encampment of Crows or
Sioux strike their tents or wigwams. I have seen
several hundred lodges all standing; in two or
three minutes after, all were flat upon the prairie.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Why, it must be like magic.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The time has been fixed, preparations
made, the signal given, and all at once the poles
and skin coverings have been taken down.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> How do they carry the wigwams away
with them?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The poles are dragged along by horses
and by dogs; the smaller ends being fastened
over their shoulders, while on the larger ends,
dragging along the ground, are placed the coverings,
rolled up together. The dogs pull along
two poles, each with a load, while the horses are
taxed according to their strength. Hundreds of
horses and dogs, thus dragging their burdens,
may be seen slowly moving over the prairie with
attendant Indians on horseback, and women and
girls on foot heavily laden.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> What a sight! and to what length they
must stretch out; such a number of them!</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Some of their villages are large, and
fortified with two rows of high poles round them.
A Pawnee Pict village on the Red River, with its
five or six hundred beehive-like wigwams of
poles, thatched with prairie grass, much pleased
me. Round the village there were fields of maize,
melons and pumpkins growing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>The Indians hunt, fish, and some of them raise
corn for food; but the flesh of the buffalo is what
they most depend upon.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> How do the Indians cook their food?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> They broil or roast meat and fish, by
laying it on the fire, or on sticks raised above the
fire. They boil meat, also, making of it a sort
of soup. I have often seated myself, squatting
down on a robe spread for me, to a fine joint of
buffalo ribs, admirably roasted; with, perhaps, a
pudding-like paste of the prairie turnip, flavoured
with buffalo berries.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> That is a great deal like an English
dinner&mdash;roast beef and a pudding.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The Indians eat a great deal of green
corn, pemican, and marrow fat. The pemican is
buffalo meat, dried hard, and pounded in a
wooden mortar. Marrow fat is what is boiled
out of buffalo bones; it is usually kept in bladders.
They eat, also, the flesh of the deer and
other animals: that of the dog is reserved for
feasts and especial occasions. They have, also,
beans and peas, peaches, melons and strawberries,
pears, pumpkins, chinkapins, walnuts and chestnuts.
These things they can get when settled in
their villages; but when wandering, or on their
war parties, they take up with what they can find.
They never eat salt with their food.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> And what kind of clothes do they wear?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Principally skins, unless they trade
with the whites, in which case they buy clothes
of different kinds. Some wear long hair, some
cut their hair off and shave the head. Some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
dress themselves with very few ornaments, but
others have very many. Shall I describe to you
the full dress of <i>M&aacute;h-to-t&oacute;h-pa</i>, &#8220;the four bears.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Oh, yes; every thing belonging to
him.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> You must imagine, then, that he is
standing up before you, while I describe him, and
that he is not a little proud of his costly attire.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> I fancy that I can see him now.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> His robe was the soft skin of a young
buffalo bull. On one side was the fur; on the
other, were pictured the victories he had won.
His shirt, or tunic, was made of the skins of mountain
sheep, ornamented with porcupine quills and
paintings of his battles. From the edge of his
shoulder-band hung the long black locks that he
had taken with his own hand from his enemies.
His head-dress was of war-eagle quills, falling
down his back to his very feet; on the top of his
head stood a pair of buffalo horns, shaven thin,
and polished beautifully.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> What a figure he must have made!</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> His leggings were tight, decorated with
porcupine quills and scalp-locks: they were made
of the finest deer skins, and fastened to a belt round
the waist. His mocassins, or shoes, were buckskin,
embroidered in the richest manner; and his
necklace, the skin of an otter, having on it fifty
huge claws, or rather talons, of the grizzly bear.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> What a desperate fellow! Bold as a
lion, I will be bound for it. Had he no weapons
about him?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Oh, yes! He held in his left hand a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
two-edged spear of polished steel, with a shaft of
tough ash, and ornamented with tufts of war-eagle
quills. His bow, beautifully white, was
formed of bone, strengthened with the sinews of
deer, drawn tight over the back of it; the bow-string
was a three-fold twist of sinews. Seldom
had its twang been heard, without an enemy or a
buffalo falling to the earth; and rarely had that
lance been urged home, without finding its way
to some victim&#8217;s heart.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Yes; I thought he was a bold fellow.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> He had a costly shield of the hide of
a buffalo, stiffened with glue and fringed round
with eagle quills and antelope hoofs; and a quiver
of panther skin, well filled with deadly shafts.
Some of their points were flint, and some were
steel, and most of them were stained with blood.
He carried a pipe, a tobacco sack, a belt, and a
medicine bag; and in his right hand he held a
war club like a sling, being made of a round
stone wrapped up in a raw hide and fastened to a
tough stick handle.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> What sort of a pipe was it?</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> What was in his tobacco sack?</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> You did not say what his belt was
made of.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> His pipe was made of red pipe-stone,
and it had a stem of young ash, full three feet
long, braided with porcupine quills in the shape
of animals and men. It was also ornamented
with the beaks of woodpeckers, and hairs from
the tail of the white buffalo. One thing I ought
not to omit; on the lower half of the pipe, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
was painted red, were notched the snows, or years
of his life. By this simple record of their lives,
the red men of the forest and the prairie may be
led to something like reflection.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> What was in his tobacco sack?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> His flint and steel, for striking a light,
and his tobacco, which was nothing more than
the bark of the red willow. His medicine bag
was beaver skin, adorned with ermine and hawks&#8217;
bills; and his belt, in which he carried his tomahawk
and scalping-knife, was formed of tough
buckskin, firmly fastened round his loins.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Please to tell us about the scalping
knife. It must be a fearful instrument.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> All instruments of cruelty, vengeance
and destruction are fearful, whether in savage or
civilized life. What are we, that wrath and revenge
and covetousness should be fostered in our
hearts! What is man, that he should shed the
blood of his brother! Before the Indians had dealing
with the whites, they made their own weapons:
their bows were strung with the sinews of deer;
their arrows were headed with flint; their knives
were sharpened bone; their war-clubs were formed
of wood, cut into different shapes, and armed
with sharp stones; and their tomahawks, or
hatchets, were of the same materials: but now,
many of their weapons, such as hatchets, spear-heads,
and knives, are made of iron, being procured
from the whites, in exchange for the skins
they obtain in the chase. A scalping-knife is
oftentimes no more than a rudely formed butcher&#8217;s<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
knife, with one edge, and the Indians wear them
in beautiful scabbards under their belts.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> How does an Indian scalp his enemy?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The hair on the crown of the head
is seized with the left hand; the knife makes a
circle round it through the skin, and then the hair
and skin together, sometimes with the hand, and
sometimes with the teeth, are forcibly torn off! The
scalp may be, perhaps, as broad as my hand.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> Terrible! Scalping would be sure to
kill a man, I suppose.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Not always. Scalps are war trophies,
and are generally regarded as proofs of the death
of an enemy; but an Indian, inflamed with hatred
and rage, and excited by victory, will not always
wait till his foe has expired before he scalps him.
The hair, as well as the scalp, of a fallen foe is
carried off by the victorious Indian, and with it
his clothes are afterwards ornamented. It is said,
that, during the old French war, an Indian slew
a Frenchman who wore a wig. The warrior
stooped down, and seized the hair for the purpose
of securing the scalp. To his great astonishment,
the wig came off, leaving the head bare. The
Indian held it up, and examining it with great
wonder, exclaimed, in broken English, &#8220;Dat one
big lie.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> How the Indian would stare!</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> He had never seen a wig before, I
dare say.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The arms of Indians, offensive and
defensive, are, for the most part, those which I
have mentioned&mdash;the club, the tomahawk, the bow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
and arrow, the spear, the shield and the scalping-knife.
But the use of fire-arms is gradually extending
among them. Some of their clubs are
merely massy pieces of hard, heavy wood, nicely
fitted to the hand, with, perhaps, a piece of hard
bone stuck in the head part; others are curiously
carved into fanciful and uncouth shapes; while,
occasionally, may be seen a frightful war-club,
knobbed all over with brass nails, with a steel
blade at the end of it, a span long.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> What a terrible weapon, when wielded
by a savage!</p>

</div>

<p><i>Brian.</i> I would not go among the Indians,
with their clubs and tomahawks, for a thousand
dollars.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> Nor would I: they would be sure to
kill me.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The tomahawk is often carved in a
strange manner; and some of the bows and arrows<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
are admirable. The bow formed of bone
and strong sinews is a deadly weapon; and some
Indians have boasted of having sent an arrow
from its strings right through the body of a buffalo.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> What a strong arm that Indian must
have had! Through a buffalo&#8217;s body!</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The quiver is made of the skin of
the panther, or the otter; and some of the arrows
it contains are usually poisoned.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> Why, then, an arrow is sure to kill a
person, if it hits him.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> It is not likely that an enemy, badly
wounded with a poisoned arrow, will survive; for
the head is set on loosely, in order that, when the
arrow is withdrawn, the poisoned barb may remain
in the wound. How opposed are these cruel
stratagems of war to the precepts of the gospel
of peace, which are &#8220;Love your enemies, bless
them that curse you, do good to them that hate
you, and pray for them which despitefully use you,
and persecute you!&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> What will you do, Austin, if you go
among the Indians, and they shoot you with a
poisoned arrow?</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Oh, I shall carry a shield. You
heard that the Indians carry shields.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The shields of the Crows and Blackfeet
are made of the thick skin of the buffalo&#8217;s
neck: they are made as hard as possible, by
smoking them, and by putting glue upon them
obtained from the hoofs of animals; so that they
will not only turn aside an arrow, but even a
musket ball, if they are held a little obliquely.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> There, Basil! You see that I shall be
safe, after all; for I shall carry a large shield, and
the very hardest I can get anywhere.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Their spears have long, slender handles,
with steel heads: the handles are a dozen feet
long, or more, and very skilful are they in the use
of them; and yet, such is the dread of the Indian
when opposed to a white man, that, in spite of
his war horse and his eagle plumes, his bow and
well-filled quiver, his long lance, tomahawk and
scalping-knife, his self-possession forsakes him.
He has heard, if not seen, what the white man
has done; and he thinks there is no standing before
him. If he can surprise him, he will; but,
generally, the red man fears to grapple with a pale
face in the strife of war, for he considers him
clothed with an unknown power.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> I should have thought that an Indian
would be more than a match for a white
man.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> So long as he can crawl in the grass
or brushwood, and steal silently upon him by surprise,
or send a shaft from his bow from behind a
tree, or a bullet from his rifle from the brow of a
bluff, he has an advantage; but, when he comes
face to face with the white man, he is superstitiously
afraid of him. The power of the white
man, in war, is that of bravery and skill; the
power of the red man consists much in stratagem
and surprise. Fifty white men, armed, on an
open plain, would beat off a hundred red men.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> Why is it that the red men are always
fighting against one another? They are all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
brothers, and what is the use of their killing one
another?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Most of the battles, among the Indians,
are brought about by the belief that they are bound
to revenge an injury to their tribe. There can be
no peace till revenge is taken; they are almost
always retaliating one on another. Then, again,
the red men have too often been tempted, bribed,
and, in some cases, forced to fight for the white
man.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> That is very sad, though.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> It is sad; but when you say red men
are brothers, are not white men brothers too?
And have they not been instructed in the truths
of Christianity, and the gospel of peace, which
red men have not, and yet how ready they are to
draw the sword! War springs from sinful passions;
and until sin is subdued in the human heart, war
will ever be congenial to it.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> What do the Indians call the sun?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The different tribes speak different languages,
and therefore you must tell me which of
them you mean.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Oh! I forgot that. Tell me what any
two or three of the tribes call it.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> A Sioux calls it <i>wee</i>; a Mandan, <i>menahka</i>;
a Tuscarora, <i>hiday</i>; and a Blackfoot,
<i>cristeque ahtose</i>.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> The Blackfoot is the hardest to remember.
I should not like to learn that language.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> But you must learn it, if you go among
them; or else you will not understand a word
they say.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Well! I shall manage it somehow or
other. Perhaps some of them may know English;
or we may make motions one to another. What
do they call the moon?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> A Blackfoot calls it <i>coque ahtose</i>; a
Sioux, <i>on wee</i>; a Riccaree, <i>wetah</i>; a Mandan, <i>esto
menahka</i>; and a Tuscarora, <i>autsunyehaw</i>.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> I wish you joy of the languages you
have to learn, Austin, if you become a wood-ranger,
or a trapper. Remember, you must learn
them all; and you will have quite enough to do,
I warrant you.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Oh! I shall learn a little at a time.
We cannot do every thing at once. What do the
red men call a buffalo?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> In Riccaree, it is <i>watash</i>; in Mandan,
<i>ptemday</i>; in Tuscarora, <i>hohats</i>; in Blackfoot,
<i>eneuh</i>.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> What different names they give them!</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Yes. In some instances they are alike,
but generally they differ. If you were to say
&#8220;How do you do?&#8221; as is the custom with us;
you must say among the Indians, <i>How ke che
wa?</i> <i>Chee na e num?</i> <i>Dati youthay its?</i> or,
<i>Tush hah thah mah kah hush?</i> according to the
language in which you spoke. I hardly think
these languages would suit you so well as your
own.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> They would never suit me; but Austin
must learn every word of them.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Please to tell us how to count ten, and
then we will ask you no more about languages.
Let it be in the language of the Riccarees.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Very well. <i>Asco, pitco, tow wit, tchee
tish, tchee hoo, tcha pis, to tcha pis, to tcha pis won,
nah e ne won, nah en.</i> I will just add, that <i>weetah</i>,
is twenty; <i>nahen tchee hoo</i>, is fifty; <i>nah en te tcha
pis won</i>, is eighty; <i>shok tan</i>, is a hundred; and
<i>sho tan tera hoo</i>, is a thousand.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Can the Indians write?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Oh no; they have no use for pen and
ink, excepting some of the tribes near the whites.
In many of the different treaties which have been
made between the white and the red man, the
latter has put, instead of his name, a rough drawing
of the animal or thing after which he had been
called. If the Indian chief was named &#8220;War
hatchet,&#8221; he made a rough outline of a tomahawk.
If his name was &#8220;The great buffalo&#8221; then the
outline of a buffalo was his signature.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> How curious!</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The <i>Big turtle</i>, the <i>Fish</i>, the <i>Scalp</i>,
the <i>Arrow</i>, and the <i>Big canoe</i>, all draw the form
represented by their names in the same manner.
If you were to see these signatures, you would
not think these Indian chiefs had ever taken lessons
in drawing.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> I dare say their fish, and arrows, and
hatchets, and turtles, and buffaloes, are comical
figures enough.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Yes: but the hands that make these
feeble scrawls are strong, when they wield the
bow or the tomahawk. A white man in the Indian
country, according to a story that is told,
met a Shawnese riding a horse, which he recognised
as his own, and claimed it as his property.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
The Indian calmly answered: &#8220;Friend,
after a little while I will call on you at your house,
when we will talk this matter over.&#8221; A few
days afterwards, the Indian came to the white
man&#8217;s house, who insisted on having his horse
restored to him. The other then told him:
&#8220;Friend, the horse which you claim belonged to
my uncle, who lately died; according to the
Indian custom, I have become heir to all his property.&#8221;
The white man not being satisfied, and
renewing his demand, the Indian immediately took
a coal from the fire-place, and made two striking
figures on the door of the house; the one representing
the white man taking the horse, and the
other himself in the act of scalping him: then he
coolly asked the trembling claimant whether he
could read this Indian writing. The matter was
thus settled at once, and the Indian rode off.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Ay; the white man knew that he had
better give up the horse than be scalped.</p>

<p>After the hunter had told Austin and his
brothers that he should be sure to have something
new to tell them on their next visit, they took their
departure, having quite enough to occupy their
minds till they reached home.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Black Hawk</span>! Black Hawk!&#8221; cried out
Austin Edwards, as he came in sight of the
hunter, who was just returning to his cottage as
Austin and his brothers reached it. &#8220;You
promised to tell us all about Black Hawk, and we
are come to hear it now.&#8221;</p>

<p>The hunter told the boys that it had been his
intention to talk with them about the prairies and
bluffs, and to have described the wondrous works
of God in the wilderness. It appeared, however,
that Austin&#8217;s heart was too much set on hearing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the history of Black Hawk, to listen patiently to
any thing else; and the hunter, perceiving this,
willingly agreed to gratify him. He told them,
that, in reading or hearing the history of Indian
chiefs, they must not be carried away by false notions
of their valour, for that it was always mingled
with much cruelty. The word of God said truly,
that &#8220;the dark places of the earth are full of the
habitations of cruelty.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_2_8" id="FNanchor_2_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_8" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> &#8220;With untaught Indians,&#8221;
continued he, &#8220;revenge is virtue; and to
tomahawk an enemy, and tear away his scalp, is
the noblest act he can perform in his own estimation;
whereas Christians are taught, as I said before,
to forgive and love their enemies. But I
will now begin the history of Black Hawk.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Suppose you tell us his history just as he
would tell it himself. Speak to us as if you were
Black Hawk, and we will not say a single word.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Very well. Then, for a while, I will
be Black Hawk, and what I tell you will be true,
only the words will be my own, instead of those
of the Indian chief. And I will speak as if I
spoke to American white men.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am an old man, the changes of many moons
and the toils of war have made me old. I have
been a conqueror, and I have been conquered:
many moons longer I cannot hope to live.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have hated the whites, but have been treated
well by them when a prisoner. I wish, before I
go my long journey, at the command of the Great
Spirit, to the hunting grounds of my fathers in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>another world, to tell my history; it will then be
seen why I hated the whites. Bold and proud
was I once, in my native forests, but the pale faces
deceived me; it was for this that I hated them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you know where I was born? I will
tell you. It was at the Sac village on Rock River.
This was, according to white man&#8217;s reckoning,
in the year 1767, so that I am fifty years old, and
ten and seven.</p>

<p>&#8220;My father&#8217;s name was Py-e-sa; the father of
his father was Na-n&agrave;-ma-kee, or Thunder. I was
a brave, and afterwards a chief, a leading war-chief,
carrying the medicine bag. I fought against
the Osages. Did I fear them? No. Did I often
win the victory? I did.</p>

<p>&#8220;The white men of America said to the Sacs
and Foxes, to the Sioux, the Chippewas, and
Winnebagoes, &#8216;Go you to the other side of the
Mississippi;&#8217; and they said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; But I said,
&#8216;No: why should I leave the place where our
wigwams stand, where we have hunted for so
many moons, and where the bones of our fathers
have rested? Ma-ka-tai-me-she-kia-kiak, or Black
Hawk, will not go.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;My heart told me that my great white father,
the chief of America, would not do wrong; would
not make me go to the other side of the river.
My prophet also told me the same. I felt my arm
strong, and I fought. Never did the hand of
Black Hawk kill woman or child. They were
warriors that Black Hawk fought with.</p>

<p>&#8220;Though I came down from the chief Na-n&agrave;-ma-kee,
yet my people would not let me dress like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
a chief. I did not paint myself; I did not wear
feathers; but I was bold and not afraid to fight,
so I became a brave.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Osages were our enemies, and I went
with my father and many more to fight. I saw
my father kill an enemy, and tear away the scalp
from his head. I felt determined to do the same.
I pleased my father; for, with my tomahawk and
spear, I rushed on an enemy. I brought back
his scalp in my hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I next led on seven of our people against a
hundred Osages, and killed one. After that, I
led on two hundred, when we killed a hundred,
and took many scalps. In a battle with the Cherokees
my father was killed. I painted my face
black, and prayed to the Great Spirit, and did not
fight any more for five years; all that I did was
to hunt and to fish.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Osages had done us great wrong, so we
were determined to destroy them. I set off, in the
third moon, at the head of five hundred Sacs and
Foxes, and one hundred Ioways. We fell upon
forty lodges. I made two of their squaws prisoners,
but all the rest of the people in the lodges we
killed. Black Hawk killed seven men himself.
In a battle with the Cherokees, I killed thirteen
of their bravest with my own hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;One of our people killed a pale-face American,
and he was put in prison; so we sent to St.
Louis, to pay for the killed man, and to cover the
blood. Did the pale faces do well? No, they
did not; they set our man free, but when he began
to run they shot him down; and they gave strong<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
drink to our four people, and told them to give up
the best part of our hunting ground for a thousand
dollars every twelve moons. What right had
they to give our men strong drink, and then cheat
them? None.</p>

<p>&#8220;American white faces came, with a great, big
gun, to build a fort, and said it was to trade with
us. They treated the Indians ill: we went against
the fort. I dug a hole in the ground with my
knife, so that I could hide myself with some grass.
I shot with my rifle and cut the cord of their flag,
so that they could not pull it up to fly in the air;
and we fired the fort, but they put out the fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;One of our people killed a white, and was
taken. He was to die, but asked leave to go and
see his squaw and children. They let him go,
but he ran back through the prairies next day, in
time to be shot down. He did not say he would
come back, and then stay; he was an Indian, and
not a white man. I hunted and fished for his
squaw and children when he was dead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why was it that the Great Spirit did not keep
the white men where he put them? Why did he
let them come among my people with their fire-drink,
sickness, and guns? It had been better
for red men to be by themselves.</p>

<p>&#8220;We went to a great English brave, Colonel
Dixon, at Green Bay: there were many Pottawatomies,
Kickapoos, Ottowas, and Winnebagoes
there. The great brave gave us pipes, tobacco,
new guns, powder, and clothes. I held a talk
with him in his tent; he took my hand. &#8216;General
Black Hawk,&#8217; said he, and he put a medal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
round my neck, &#8216;you must now hold us fast by
the hand; you will have the command of all the
braves to join our own braves at Detroit.&#8217; I was
sorry, because I wanted to go to Mississippi.
But he said, &#8216;No; you are too brave to kill
women and children: you must kill braves.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;We had a feast, and I led away five hundred
braves to join the British. Sometimes we won,
and sometimes we lost. The Indians were killing
the prisoners, but Black Hawk stopped them.
He is a coward who kills a brave that has no arms
and cannot fight. I did not like so often to be
beaten in battle, and to get no plunder. I left the
British, with twenty of my braves, to go home,
and see after my wife and children.</p>

<p>&#8220;I found an old friend of mine sitting on a
mat in sorrow: he had come to be alone, and to
make himself little before the Great Spirit: he
had fasted long, he was hardly alive; his son had
been taken prisoner, and shot and stabbed to death.
I put my pipe to my friend&#8217;s mouth; he smoked
a little. I took his hand, and said &#8216;Black Hawk
would revenge his son&#8217;s death.&#8217; A storm came
on; I wrapped my old friend in my blanket. The
storm gave over; I made a fire. It was too late;
my friend was dead. I stopped with him the remainder
of the night; and then my people came,
and we buried him on the peak of the bluff.</p>

<p>&#8220;I explained to my people the way the white
men fight. Instead of stealing on each other,
quietly and by surprise, to kill their enemies and
save their own people, they all fight in the sunlight,
like braves; not caring how many of their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
people fall. They then feast and drink as if nothing
had happened, and write on paper that they
have won, whether they have won or been beaten.
And they do not write truth, for they only put
down a part of the people they have lost. They
would do to <i>paddle</i> a canoe, but not to <i>steer</i> it.
They fight like braves, but they are not fit to be
chiefs, and to lead war parties.</p>

<p>&#8220;I found my wife well, and my children, and
would have been quiet in my lodge; for, while I
was away, Kee-o-kuk had been made a chief: but
I had to revenge the death of the son of my old
friend. I told my friend so when he was dying.
Why should Black Hawk speak a lie? I took
with me thirty braves, and went to Fort Madison;
but the American pale faces had gone. I was
glad, but still followed them down the Mississippi.
I went on their trail. I shot the chief of the party
with whom we fought. We returned home, bringing
two scalps. Black Hawk had done what he
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Many things happened. Old W&agrave;sh-e-own,
one of the Pottawatomies, was shot dead by
a war chief. I gave W&agrave;sh-e-own&#8217;s relations two
horses and my rifles to keep the peace. A party
of soldiers built a fort at Prairie du Chien. They
were friendly to us, but the British came and took
the fort. We joined them; we followed the boats
and shot fire-arrows, and the sails of one boat
were burned, and we took it.</p>

<p>&#8220;We found, in the boats we had taken, barrels
of whiskey: this was bad medicine. We knocked
in the heads of the barrels, and emptied out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
the bad medicine. We found bottles and packages,
which we flung into the river as bad medicine
too. We found guns and clothes, which I
divided with my braves. The Americans built a
fort; I went towards it with my braves. I had a
dream, in which the Great Spirit told me to go
down the bluff to a creek, and to look in a hollow
tree cut down, and there I should see a snake;
close by would be the enemy unarmed. I went
to the creek, peeped into the tree, saw the snake,
and found the enemy. One man of them was
killed, after that we returned home: peace was
made between the British and Americans, and we
were to bury the tomahawk too.</p>

<p>&#8220;We went to the great American chief at St.
Louis, and smoked the pipe of peace. The chief
said our great American father was angry with us,
and accused us of crimes. We said this was a
lie; for our great father had deceived us, and
forced us into a war. They were angry at what
we said; but we smoked the pipe of peace again,
and I first touched the goose quill; but I did not
know that, in doing so, I gave away my village.
Had I known it, I would never have touched the
goose quill.</p>

<p>&#8220;The American whites built a fort on Rock
Island; this made us sorry, for it was our garden,
like what the white people have near their big villages.
It supplied us with plums, apples and nuts,
with strawberries and blackberries. Many happy
days had I spent on Rock Island. A good spirit had
the care of it; he lived under the rock, in a cave.
He was white, and his wings were ten times bigger<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
than swan&#8217;s wings: when the white men came
there, he went away.</p>

<p>&#8220;We had corn and beans and pumpkins and
squashes. We were the possessors of the valley
of the Mississippi, full seven hundred miles from
the Ouisconsin to the Portage des Sioux, near the
mouth of the Missouri. If another prophet had
come to us in those days, and said, &#8216;The white
man will drive you from these hunting grounds,
and from this village, and Rock Island, and not
let you visit the graves of your fathers,&#8217; we should
have said, &#8216;Why should you tell us a lie?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was good to go to the graves of our fathers.
The mother went there to weep over her child:
the brave went there to paint the post where lay
his father. There was no place in sorrow like
that where the bones of our forefathers lay. There
the Great Spirit took pity on us. In our village,
we were as happy as a buffalo on the plains; but
now we are more like the hungry and howling
wolf in the prairie.</p>

<p>&#8220;As the whites came nearer to us, we became
more unhappy. They gave our people strong
liquor, and I could not keep them from drinking
it. My eldest son and my youngest daughter
died. I gave away all I had; blackened my face
for two years, lived alone with my family, to humble
myself before the Great Spirit. I had only a
piece of buffalo robe to cover me.</p>

<p>&#8220;White men came and took part of our lodges;
and Kee-o-kuk told me I had better go West, as
he had done. I said I could not forsake my village;
the prophet told me I was right. I thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
then that Kee-o-kuk was no brave, but a coward,
to give up what the Great Spirit had given us.</p>

<p>&#8220;The white men grew more and more; brought
whiskey among us, cheated us out of our guns,
our horses and our traps, and ploughed up our
grounds. They treated us cruelly; and, while
they robbed us, said that we robbed them. They
made right look like wrong, and wrong like right.
I tried hard to get right, but could not. The
white man wanted my village, and back I must
go. Sixteen thousand dollars every twelve moons
are to be given to the Pottawatomies for a little
strip of land, while one thousand dollars only was
set down for our land signed away, worth twenty
times as much. White man is too great a cheat
for red man.</p>

<p>&#8220;A great chief, with many soldiers, came to
drive us away. I went to the prophet, who told
me not to be afraid. They only wanted to frighten
us, and get our land without paying for it. I had
a talk with the great chief. He said if I would
go, well. If I would not, he would drive me.
&#8216;Who is Black Hawk?&#8217; said he. &#8216;I am a
Sac,&#8217; said I; &#8216;my forefather was a Sac; and
all the nation call me a Sac.&#8217; But he said I
should go.</p>

<p>&#8220;I crossed the Mississippi with my people,
during the night, and we held a council. I
touched the goose quill again, and they gave us
some corn, but it was soon gone. Then our women
and children cried out for the roasted ears,
the beans, and squashes they had been used to,
and some of our braves went back in the night,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
to take some corn from our own fields; the whites
saw and fired upon them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wished our great American father to do us
justice. I wished to go to him with others, but
difficulties were thrown in the way. I consulted
the prophet, and recruited my bands to take my
village again; for I knew that it had been sold
by a few, without the consent of the many. It
was a cheat. I said, &#8216;I will not leave the place
of my fathers.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;With my braves and warriors, on horseback,
I moved up the river, and took with us our women
and children in canoes. Our prophet was among
us. The great war chief, White Beaver, sent
twice to tell us to go back; and that, if we did
not, he would come and drive us. Black Hawk&#8217;s
message was this: &#8216;If you wish to fight us, come
on.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;We were soon at war; but I did not wish
it: I tried to be at peace; but when I sent parties
with a white flag, some of my parties were
shot down. The whites behaved ill to me, they
forced me into war, with five hundred warriors,
when they had against us three or four thousand.
I often beat them, driving back hundreds, with a
few braves, not half their number. We moved on
to the Four Lakes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I made a dog feast before I left my camp.
Before my braves feasted, I took my great medicine
bag, and made a speech to my people; this
was my speech:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Braves and warriors! these are the medicine
bags of our forefather, Muk-a-t&agrave;-quet, who was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
the father of the Sac nation. They were handed
down to the great war chief of our nation, Na-n&agrave;-ma-kee,
who has been at war with all the nations
of the lakes, and all the nations of the plains, and
they have never yet been disgraced. I expect
you all to protect them.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;We went to Mos-co-ho-co-y-nak, where the
whites had built a fort. We had several battles;
but the whites so much outnumbered us, it was
in vain. We had not enough to eat. We dug
roots, and pulled the bark from trees, to keep us
alive; some of our old people died of hunger.
I determined to remove our women across the
Mississippi, that they might return again to the
Sac nation.</p>

<p>&#8220;We arrived at the Ouisconsin, and had begun
crossing over, when the enemy came in great
force. We had either to fight, or to sacrifice our
women and children. I was mounted on a fine
horse, and addressed my warriors, encouraging
them to be brave. With fifty of them I fought
long enough to let our women cross the river,
losing only six men: this was conduct worthy a
brave.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was sad for us that a party of soldiers from
Prairie du Chien were stationed on the Ouisconsin,
and these fired on our distressed women: was
this brave? No. Some were killed, some taken
prisoners, and the rest escaped into the woods.
After many battles, I found the white men too
strong for us; and thinking there would be no
peace while Black Hawk was at the head of his
braves, I gave myself up and my great medicine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
bag. &#8216;Take it,&#8217; said I. &#8216;It is the soul of the
Sac nation: it has never been dishonoured in any
battle. Take it; it is my life, dearer than life;
let it be given to the great American chief.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understood afterwards, a large party of Sioux
attacked our women, children, and people, who
had crossed the Mississippi, and killed sixty of
them: this was hard, and ought not to have been
allowed by the whites.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was sent to Jefferson Barracks, and afterwards
to my great American father at Washington.
He wanted to know why I went to war with his
people. I said but little, for I thought he ought
to have known why before, and perhaps he did;
perhaps he knew that I was deceived and forced
into war. His wigwam is built very strong. I
think him to be a good little man, and a great
brave.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was treated well at all the places I passed
through; Louisville, Cincinnati, and Wheeling;
and afterwards at Fortress Monroe, Baltimore, Philadelphia,
and the big village of New York; and
I was allowed to return home again to my people,
of whom Kee-o-kuk, the Running Fox, is now
the chief. I sent for my great medicine bag, for
I wished to hand it down unsullied to my nation.</p>

<p>&#8220;It has been said that Black Hawk murdered
women and children among the whites; but it is
not true. When the white man takes my hand,
he takes a hand that has only been raised against
warriors and braves. It has always been our custom
to receive the stranger, and to use him well.
The white man shall ever be welcome among us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
as a brother. What is done is past; we have
buried the tomahawk, and the Sacs and Foxes
and Americans will now be friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;As I said, I am an old man, and younger
men must take my place. A few more snows,
and I shall go where my fathers are. It is the
wish of the heart of Black Hawk, that the Great
Spirit may keep the red men and pale faces in
peace, and that the tomahawk may be buried for
ever.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Poor Black Hawk! He went through
a great deal. And Kee-o-kuk, the Running Fox,
was made chief instead of him.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Kee-o-kuk was a man more inclined
to peace than war; for, while Black Hawk was
fighting, he kept two-thirds of the tribe in peace.
The time may come, when Indians may love
peace as much as they now love war; and when
the &#8220;peace of God which passeth all understanding&#8221;
may &#8220;keep their hearts and minds in the
knowledge and love of God, and of his Son Jesus
Christ our Lord.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Now, just before we go, will you
please to tell us a little about a buffalo hunt; just
a little, and then we shall talk about it, and about
Black Hawk, all the way home.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Well, it must be a short account now;
perhaps I may describe another hunt, more at
length, another time. In hunting the buffalo, the
rifle, the lance, and the bow and arrow are used,
as the case may be. I have hunted with the Camanchees
in the Mexican provinces, who are
famous horsemen; with the Sioux, on the Mississippi;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
the Crows, on the Yellow-stone river; and
the Pawnees, at the Rocky Mountains. One
morning, when among the Crows, a muster took
place for a buffalo hunt: you may be sure that I
joined them, for at that time I was almost an Indian
myself.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> How did you prepare for the hunt?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> As soon as we had notice, from the
top of a bluff in the distance, that a herd of
buffaloes was on the prairie, we prepared our
horses; while some Indians were directed to follow
our trail, with one-horse carts, to bring home
the meat.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> You were sure, then, that you should
kill some buffaloes.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Yes; we had but little doubt on that
head. I threw off my cap; stripped off my coat;
tying a handkerchief round my head, and another
round my waist; rolled up my sleeves; hastily
put a few bullets in my mouth, and mounted a
fleet horse, armed with a rifle and a thin, long
spear: but most of the Crows had also bows and
arrows.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> Your thin spear would soon be broken.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> No; these thin, long spears are sometimes
used, in buffalo hunting, for years without
breaking. When an Indian chases a buffalo, if
he does not use his rifle or bow and arrow, he
rides on fast till he comes up with his game, and
makes his horse gallop just the same pace as the
buffalo. Every bound his horse gives, the Indian
keeps moving his spear backwards and forwards
across the pommel of his saddle, with the point<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
sideways towards the buffalo. He gallops on in
this way, saying &#8220;Whish! whish!&#8221; every time
he makes a feint, until he finds himself in just the
situation to inflict a deadly wound; then, in a
moment, with all his strength, he plunges in his
lance, quick as lightning, near the shoulders of
the buffalo, and withdraws it at the same instant:
the lance, therefore, is not broken, though the
buffalo may be mortally wounded.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> The poor buffalo has no chance at all.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Well! you mounted your horse, and
rode off at full gallop&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> No; we walked our steeds all abreast,
until we were seen by the herd of buffaloes. On
catching sight of us, in an instant they set off,
and we after them as hard as we could drive, a
cloud of dust rising from the prairie, occasioned
by the trampling hoofs of the buffaloes.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> What a scamper there must be!</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Rifles were flashing, bowstrings were
twanging, spears were dashed into the fattest of
the herd, and buffaloes were falling in all directions.
Here was seen an Indian rolling on the
ground, and there a horse gored to death by a
buffalo bull. I brought down one of the largest
of the herd with my rifle, at the beginning of the
hunt; and, before it was ended, we had as many
buffaloes as we knew what to do with. Some of
the party had loaded their rifles four or five times,
while at full gallop, bringing down a buffalo at
every fire.</p>

<p>Very willingly would Austin have lingered long
enough to hear of half a dozen buffalo hunts;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
but, bearing in mind what had been said about a
longer account at another time, he cordially
thanked the hunter for all he had told them, and
set off home, with a light heart, in earnest conversation
with his brothers.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> description of the buffalo hunt, given by
the hunter, made a deep impression on the minds
of the young people; and the manner of using
the long, thin lance called forth their wonder, and
excited their emulation. Austin became a Camanchee
from the Mexican provinces, the Camanchees
being among the most expert lancers and
horsemen; Brian called himself a Sioux, from the
Mississippi; and Basil styled himself a Pawnee,
from the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p>Many were the plans and expedients to get up
a buffalo hunt upon a large scale, but the difficulty
of procuring buffaloes was insurmountable. Austin,
it is true, did suggest an inroad among the
flock of sheep of a neighbouring farmer maintaining<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
that the scampering of the sheep would
very much resemble the flight of a herd of buffaloes;
but this suggestion was given up, on the
ground that the farmer might not think it so entertaining
an amusement as they did.</p>

<p>It was doubtful, at one time, whether, in their
extremity, they should not be compelled to convert
the chairs and tables into buffaloes; but
Austin, whose heart was in the thing, had a bright
thought, which received universal approbation.
This was to make buffaloes of their playfellow
Jowler, the Newfoundland dog, and the black
tom-cat. Jowler, with his shining shaggy skin,
was sure to make a capital buffalo; and Black
Tom would do very well, as buffaloes were not
all of one size. To work they went immediately,
to prepare themselves for their adventurous
undertaking, dressing themselves up for the
approaching enterprise; and, if they did not
succeed in making themselves look like Indians,
they certainly did present a most grotesque
appearance.</p>

<p>In the best projects, however, there is oftentimes
an oversight, which bids fair to ruin the
whole undertaking; and so it was on this occasion;
for it never occurred to them, until they
were habited as hunters, to secure the attendance
of Jowler and Black Tom. Encumbered with
their lances, bows, arrows and hanging dresses,
they had to search the whole house, from top to
bottom, in quest of Black Tom; and when he was
found, a like search was made for Jowler. Both
Jowler and Black Tom were at length found, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
led forth to the lawn, which was considered to be
an excellent prairie.</p>

<p>No sooner was the signal given for the hunt to
commence, than Black Tom, being set at liberty,
instead of acting his part like a buffalo, as he
ought to have done, scampered across the lawn
to the shrubbery, and ran up a tree; while Jowler
made a rush after him; so that the hunt appeared
to have ended almost as soon as it was begun.
Jowler was brought back again to the middle of
the lawn, but no one could prevail on Black Tom
to descend from his eminence.</p>

<p>Once more Jowler, the buffalo, was set at
liberty; and Austin, Brian, and Basil, the Camanchee,
Sioux, and Pawnee chieftains, brandished
their long lances, preparing for the chase: but it
seemed as though they were to be disappointed,
for Jowler, instead of running away, according
to the plan of the hunters, provokingly kept leaping
up, first at one, and then at another of them;
until having overturned the Pawnee on the lawn,
and put the Sioux and Camanchee out of all
patience, he lay down panting, with his long red
tongue out of his mouth, looking at them just as
though he had acted his part of the affair capitally.</p>

<p>At last, not being able to reduce the refractory
Jowler to obedience, no other expedient remained
than that one of them should act the part of a
buffalo himself. Austin was very desirous that
this should be done by Brian or Basil; but they
insisted that he, being the biggest, was most like
a buffalo. The affair was at length compromised,
by each agreeing to play the buffalo in turn. A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
desperate hunt then took place, in the course of
which their long lances were most skilfully and
effectually used; three buffaloes were slain, and
the Camanchee, Sioux, and Pawnee returned in
triumph from the chase, carrying a buffalo-hide (a
rug mat from the hall) on the tops of their spears.</p>

<p>On their next visit to the hunter, they reminded
him that, the last time he saw them, he had intended
to speak about the prairies; but that the
history of Black Hawk, and the account of the
buffalo hunt, had taken up all the time. They
told him that they had come early, on purpose to
hear a long account; and, perhaps, he would be
able to tell them all about Nikkanochee into the
bargain.</p>

<p>The hunter replied, if that was the case, the
sooner he began his narrative the better; so,
without loss of time, he thus commenced his
account.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Though in our country there are
dull, monotonous rivers, with thick slimy waters,
stagnant swamps, and pine forests almost immeasureable
in extent; yet, still, some of the
most beautiful and delightful scenes in the whole
world are here.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> How big are the prairies? I want to
know more about them.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> They extend for many hundreds of miles,
though not without being divided and diversified
with other scenery. Mountains and valleys, and
forests and rivers, vary the appearance of the
country. The name <i>prairie</i> was given to the
plains of North America by the French settlers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
It is the French word for meadow. I will
describe some prairie scenes which have particularly
struck me. These vast plains are sometimes
flat; sometimes undulated, like the large waves
of the sea; sometimes barren; sometimes covered
with flowers and fruit; and sometimes there is
grass growing on them eight or ten feet high.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> I never heard of such high grass as
that.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> A prairie on fire is one of the most imposing
spectacles you can imagine. The flame is
urged on by the winds, running and spreading
out with swiftness and fury, roaring like a tempest,
and driving before it deer, wolves, horses,
and buffaloes, in wild confusion.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> How I should like to see a prairie on
fire!</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> In Missouri, Arkansas, Indiana, and
Louisiana, prairies abound; and the whole State
of Illinois is little else than a vast prairie. From
the Falls of the Missouri to St. Louis, a constant
succession of prairie and river scenes, of the most
interesting kind, meet the eye. Here the rich
green velvet turf spreads out immeasurably wide;
breaking towards the river into innumerable hills
and dales, bluffs and ravines, where mountain
goats and wolves and antelopes and elks and
buffaloes and grizzly bears roam in unrestrained
liberty. At one time, the green bluff slopes
easily down to the water&#8217;s edge; while, in other
places, the ground at the edge of the river presents
to the eye an endless variety of hill and
bluff and crag, taking the shapes of ramparts and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
ruins, of columns, porticoes, terraces, domes,
towers, citadels and castles; while here and
there seems to rise a solitary spire, which might
well pass for the work of human hands. But the
whole scene, varying in colour, and lit up and
gilded by the mid-day sun, speaks to the heart of
the spectator, convincing him that none but an
Almighty hand could thus clothe the wilderness
with beauty.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 299px;">
<img src="images/illo086.jpg" width="299" height="400" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Brian! Do you not wish now to see
the prairies of North America?</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> Yes; if I could see them without going
among the tomahawks and scalping-knives.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> I remember one part where the ragged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
cliffs and cone-like bluffs, partly washed away by
the rains, and partly crumbled down by the frosts,
seemed to be composed of earths of a mineral
kind, of clay of different colours and of red
pumice stone. The clay was white, brown, yellow
and deep blue; while the pumice stone, lit
up by the sunbeam, was red like vermilion. The
loneliness, the wildness and romantic beauty of
the scene I am not likely to forget.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> I should like to see those red rocks very
much.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> For six days I once continued my
course, with a party of Indians, across the prairie,
without setting my eyes on a single tree, or a
single hill affording variety to the scene. Grass,
wild flowers, and strawberries, abounded more
or less through the whole extent. The spot
where we found ourselves at sundown, appeared
to be exactly that from which we started
at sunrise. There was little variety, even in the
sky itself; and it would have been a relief, (so
soon are we weary even of beauty itself,) to have
walked a mile over rugged rocks, or to have
forced our way through a gloomy pine wood, or
to have climbed the sides of a steep mountain.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> I hardly think that I should ever be tired
of green grass and flowers and strawberries.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Oh yes, you would. Variety in the
works of creation is a gift of our bountiful Creator,
for which we are not sufficiently thankful. Look
at the changing seasons; how beautifully they
vary the same prospect! And the changing
clouds of heaven, too; what an infinite and pleasurable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
variety they afford to us! If the world
were all sunshine, we should long for the shade.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> What do you mean by bluffs?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Round hills, or huge clayey mounds,
often covered with grass and flowers to the very
top. Sometimes they have a verdant turf on their
tops, while their sides display a rich variety of
many-coloured earths, and thousands of gypsum
crystals imbedded in the clay. The romantic
mixture of bluffs, and hills, with summits of green
grass as level as the top of a table, with huge
fragments of pumice stone and cinders, the remains
of burning mountains, and granite sand, and layers
of different coloured clay, and cornelian, and
agate, and jasper-like pebbles; these, with the
various animals that graze or prowl among them,
and the rolling river, and a bright blue sky, have
afforded me bewildering delight. Some of the
hunters and trappers believe that the great valley
of the Missouri was once level with the tops of
the table hills, and that the earth has been washed
away by the river, and other causes; but the
subject is involved in much doubt. It has
pleased God to put a boundary to the knowledge
of man in many things. I think I ought to tell
you of Floyd&#8217;s grave.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Where was it? Who was Floyd.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> You shall hear. In the celebrated expedition
of Clark and Lewis to the Rocky Mountains,
they were accompanied by Serjeant Floyd,
who died on the way. His body was carried to
the top of a high green-carpeted bluff, on the
Missouri river, and there buried, and a cedar post<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
was erected to his memory. As I sat on his
grave, and looked around me, the stillness and
the extreme beauty of the scene much affected me.
I had endured much toil, both in hunting and
rowing; sometimes being in danger from the
grizzly bears, and, at others, with difficulty
escaping the war-parties of the Indians. My
rifle had been busy, and the swan and the pelican,
the antelope and the elk, had supplied me with
food; and as I sat on a grave, in that beautiful
bluff in the wilderness&mdash;the enamelled prairie, the
thousand grassy hills that were visible, with their
golden heads and long deep shadows, (for the
sun was setting,) and the Missouri winding in its
serpentine course, the whole scene was of the
most beautiful and tranquil kind. The soft whispering
of the evening breeze, and the distant, subdued
and melancholy howl of the wolf, were the
only sounds that reached my ears. It was a very
solitary, and yet a very delightful hour.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> I should not like to be by myself in such
a place as that.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> There is another high bluff, not many
miles from the cedar post of poor Floyd, that is
well known as the burial-place of Blackbird, a
famous chief of the O-ma-haw tribe; the manner
of his burial was extremely strange. As I was
pulling up the river, a traveller told me the story;
and, when I had heard it, we pushed our canoe
into a small creek, that I might visit the spot.
Climbing up the velvet sides of the bluff, I sat me
down by the cedar post on the grave of Blackbird.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> But what was the story? What was
there strange in the burial of the chief?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Blackbird on his way home from the
city of Washington, where he had been, died
with the small-pox. Before his death, he desired
his warriors to bury him on the bluff, sitting on
the back of his favourite war-horse, that he might
see, as he said, the Frenchmen boating up and
down the river. His beautiful white steed was
led up to the top of the bluff, and there the body
of Blackbird was placed astride upon him.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> What a strange thing!</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Blackbird had his bow in his hand,
his beautiful head dress of war-eagle plumes on
his head, his shield and quiver at his side, and
his pipe and medicine bag. His tobacco pouch
was filled, to supply him on his journey to the
hunting-grounds of his fathers; and he had flint
and steel wherewith to light his pipe by the way.
Every warrior painted his hand with vermilion,
and then pressed it against the white horse, leaving
a mark behind him. After the necessary
ceremonies had been performed, Blackbird and
his white war-horse were covered over with turf,
till they were no more seen.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> But was the white horse buried alive?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> He was. The turfs were put about
his feet, then piled up his legs, then placed against
his sides, then over his back, and lastly over
Blackbird himself and his war-eagle plumes.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> That was a very cruel deed! They
had no business to smother that beautiful white
horse in that way.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> And so I say. It was a great shame,
and I do not like that Blackbird.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Indians have strange customs. Now
I am on the subject of prairie scenes, I ought to
speak a word of the prairies on the Red River.
I had been for some time among the Creeks and
Choctaws, crossing, here and there, ridges of
wooded lands, and tracts of rich herbage, with
blue mountains in the distance, when I came to
a prairie scene of a new character. For miles
together the ground was covered with vines,
bearing endless clusters of large delicious grapes;
and then, after crossing a few broad valleys of
green turf, our progress was stopped by hundreds
of acres of plum trees, bending to the very
ground with their fruit. Among these were interspersed
patches of rose trees, wild currants, and
gooseberries, with prickly pears, and the most
beautiful and sweet-scented wild flowers.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> I never heard of so delightful a place.
What do you think of the prairies now, Basil?
Should you not like to gather some of those
fruits and flowers, Brian?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> And then just as I was stretching out
my hand to gather some of the delicious produce
of that paradise of fruit and flowers, I heard the
sound of a rattlesnake, that was preparing to make
a spring, and immediately I saw the glistening
eyes of a copper-head, which I had disturbed
beneath the tendrils and leaves.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> What do you think of the prairie now,
Austin?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> And should you not like to gather some
of those fruits and flowers?</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> I never suspected that there would be
such snakes among them.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The wild creatures of these delightful
spots may be said to live in a garden; here they
pass their lives, rarely disturbed by the approach
of man. The hunter and the trapper, however
thoughtlessly they pursue their calling, are at
times struck with the amazing beauty of the
scenes that burst upon them. God is felt to be
in the prairie. The very solitude disposes the
mind to acknowledge Him; earth and skies proclaim
his presence; the fruits of the ground declare
his bounty; and, in the flowers, ten thousand
forget-me-nots bring his goodness to remembrance.
&#8220;Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised;
and his greatness is unsearchable.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_3_9" id="FNanchor_3_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_9" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_9" id="Footnote_3_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_9"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Ps. cxlv. 3.</p></div>

<p><i>Austin.</i> I could not have believed that there
had been such beautiful places in the prairies.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Some parts are varied, and others
monotonous. Some are beautiful, and others far
from being agreeable. The Prairie la Crosse, the
Prairie du Chien, and the Couteau des Prairies on
the Mississippi, with the prairies on the Missouri,
all have some points of attraction. I did intend
to say a little about Swan Lake, the wild rice
grounds, Lover&#8217;s Leap, the salt meadows on the
Missouri, the Savannah in the Florida pine woods,
and Red Pipe-stone Quarry; but as I intend to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>give you the history of Nikkanochee, perhaps I
had better begin with it at once.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> We shall like to hear of Nikkanochee,
but it is so pleasant to hear about the prairies,
that you must, if you please, tell us a little more
about them first.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> I want to hear about those prairie dogs.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> And I want to hear of Lover&#8217;s Leap.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> What I wish to hear the most, is about
Red Pipe-stone quarry. Please to tell us a little
about them all.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Well! If you will be satisfied with
a little, I will go on. Swan Lake is one of the
most beautiful objects in the prairies of our
country. It extends for many miles; and the
islands with which it abounds are richly covered
with forest trees. Fancy to yourselves unnumbered
islands with fine trees, beautifully grouped
together, and clusters of swans on the water in
every direction. If you want to play at Robinson
Crusoe, one of the islands on Swan Lake will be
just the place for you.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> Well may it be called Swan Lake.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The first time that I saw wild rice
gathered, it much surprised and amused me. A
party of Sioux Indian women were paddling
about, near the shores of a large lake, in canoes
made of bark. While one woman paddled the
canoe, the other gathered the wild rice, which
flourished there in great abundance. By bending
it over the canoe with one stick, and then striking
it with another, the grains of rice fell in profusion
into the canoe. In this way they proceeded;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
till they obtained full cargoes of wild
rice for food.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> I wish we had wild rice growing in
our pond.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> What I have to say of Lover&#8217;s Leap
is a little melancholy. On the east side of Lake
Pepin, on the Mississippi, stands a bold rock,
lifting up its aspiring head some six or seven
hundred feet above the surface of the lake. Some
years since, as the story goes, an Indian chief
wished his daughter to take a husband that she
did not like. The daughter declined, but the
father insisted; and the poor, distracted girl, to
get rid of her difficulty, threw herself, in the presence
of her tribe, from the top of the rock, and
was dashed to pieces.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> Poor girl, indeed! Her father was a
very cruel man.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The chief was cruel, and his daughter
rash; but we must not be too severe in judging
those who have no better standard of right and
wrong than the customs of their uncivilized tribe.
It was on the Upper Missouri river, towards the
mouth of the Teton river, that I came all at once
on a salt meadow. You would have thought
that it had been snowing for an hour or two,
for the salt lay an inch or two thick on the
ground.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> What could have brought it there?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The same Almighty hand that spread
out the wild prairie, spread the salt upon its surface.
There are salt springs in many places,
where the salt water overflows the prairie. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
hot sun evaporates the water, and the salt is left
behind.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> Well, that is very curious.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The buffaloes and other animals come
by thousands to lick the salt, so that what with
the green prairie around, the white salt, and the
black buffaloes, the contrast in colour is very
striking. Though Florida is, to a great extent, a
sterile wilderness, yet, for that very reason, some
of its beautiful spots appear the more beautiful.
There are swamps enough, and alligators enough,
to make the traveller in those weary wilds cheerless
and disconsolate; but when, after plodding,
day after day, through morasses and interminable
pine woods, listening to nothing but the cry of
cranes and the howling of wolves, he comes
suddenly into an open plain covered with a
carpet of grass and myriads of wild flowers, his
eye brightens, and he recovers his cheerfulness
and strength. He again feels that God is in the
prairie.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> Remember the alligators, Austin!</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> And the howling wolves! What do
you think of them?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The Red Pipe-stone Quarry is between
the Upper Mississippi and the Upper Missouri.
It is the place where the Indians of the country
procure the red stone with which they make all
their pipes. The place is considered by them to
be sacred. They say that the Great Spirit used
to stand on the rock, and that the blood of the
buffaloes which he ate there ran into the rocks
below, and turned them red.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> That is the place I want to see.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> If you go there, you must take great
care of yourself; for the Sioux will be at your
heels. As I said, they hold the place sacred, and
consider the approach of a white man a kind of
profanation. The place is visited by all the
neighbouring tribes for stone with which to make
their pipes, whether they are at war or peace; for
the Great Spirit, say they, always watches over
it, and the war-club and scalping-knife are there
harmless. There are hundreds of old inscriptions
on the face of the rocks; and the wildest traditions
are handed down, from father to son, respecting
the place. Some of the Sioux say, that
the Great Spirit once sent his runners abroad, to
call together all the tribes that were at war, to the
Red Pipe-stone Quarry. As he stood on the top
of the rocks, he took out a piece of red stone, and
made a large pipe; he smoked it over them, and
told them, that, though at war, they must always
be at peace at that place, for that it belonged to
one as much as another, and that they must all
make their pipes of the stone. Having thus
spoken, a thick cloud of smoke from his great
red pipe rolled over them, and in it he vanished
away. Just at the moment that he took the last
whiff of his great, long, red pipe, the rocks were
wrapped in a blaze of fire, so that the surface of
them was melted. Two squaws, then, in a flash
of fire, sunk under the two medicine rocks, and
no one can take away red stone from the place
without their leave. Where the gospel is unknown,
there is nothing too improbable to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
received. The day will, no doubt, arrive, when
the wild traditions of Red Pipe-stone Quarry will
be done away, and the folly and wickedness of
all such superstitions be plainly seen.</p>

<p>Here the hunter, having to attend his sheep,
left the three brothers, to amuse themselves for
half an hour with the curiosities in his cottage;
after which, he returned to redeem his pledge, by
relating the history he had promised them.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">And</span> now,&#8221; said the hunter, &#8220;for my account
of Nikkanochee.<a name="FNanchor_4_10" id="FNanchor_4_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_10" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> I met with him in
Florida, his own country, when he was quite a
child; indeed he is even now but a boy, being
not more than twelve or thirteen years of age.
The Seminole Indians, a mixed tribe, from whom
prince Nikkanochee is descended, were a warlike
people, settled on the banks of the River Chattahoochee.
In a battle which took place between
the Indians and a party of whites, under Major
Dade, out of a hundred and fourteen white men,
only two escaped the tomahawks of their opponents.
A Seminole was about to despatch one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>of these two, when he suddenly called to mind
that the soldier had once helped him in fitting a
handle to his axe. This arrested his uplifted
weapon, and the life of the soldier was spared.&#8221;</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_10" id="Footnote_4_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_10"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> This sketch is supposed to be a narrative of facts,
though the authority for it is not within the publishers&#8217;
reach.</p></div>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Noble! noble! If all the Seminoles
were like him, they were a noble people.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The tribe had good and bad qualities;
but I tell you this anecdote, because it affords
another proof that the hardy Indian warrior, in
the midst of all his relentless animosity against
his enemy, is still sensible of a deed of kindness.
On another occasion, when the Seminoles, to
avenge injuries which their tribe had received,
wasted the neighbourhood with fire and tomahawk,
they respected the dwelling of one who
had shown kindness to some of their tribe.
Even though they visited his house, and cooked
their food at his hearth, they did no injury to his
person or his property. Other dwellings around
it were burned to the ground, but for years his
habitation remained secure from any attack on the
part of the grateful Seminoles.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> When I go abroad, I will always behave
kindly to the poor Indians.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The father of Nikkanochee was king
of the Red Hills, in the country of the Seminoles;
but not being very much distinguished as a warrior,
he gave up the command of his fighting
men to his brother Oseola, a chief famous for
bodily strength and courage. Before the war
broke out between the Seminoles, Oseola was
kind and generous; but when once the war-cry
had rung through the woods, and his tomahawk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
had been raised, he became stern and implacable.
He was the champion of his nation, and the terror
of the pale faces opposed to him.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> He must have made terrible work with
his tomahawk!</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> No doubt he did, for he was bold,
and had never been taught to control his passions.
The command of the Saviour had never reached
his ears: &#8220;Love your enemies, bless them that
curse you, do good to them that hate you, and
pray for them which despitefully use you, and
persecute you.&#8221; The red man of the forest and
the prairie has had much to embitter his spirit
against his enemies; but I will proceed. It was
in the year 1835, that between two and three
hundred red warriors assembled at Camp King, to
hold a &#8220;talk,&#8221; or council. They were met by a
battalion of white soldiers, who had two generals
with them. At this council, it was proposed by
the whites that a contract should be made between
the two parties, wherein the Seminoles should
give up their lands in Florida in exchange for
other lands at a great distance from the place.
Some of the red warriors were induced to make
a cross on the contract as their signature, showing
that they agreed therewith; but Oseola saw that
such a course was bartering away his country, and
sealing the ruin of his nation.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> I hope he did not put his sign to it.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> So do I, and I hope he persuaded all
the rest of the red warriors not to sign it.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> When they asked him in his turn to
sign the contract, his lip began to curl with contempt,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
and his eye to flash with fiery indignation.
&#8220;Yes!&#8221; said he, drawing a poniard from his
bosom, with a haughty frown on his brow.
&#8220;Yes!&#8221; said he, advancing and dashing his dagger
while he spoke, not only through the contract,
but also through the table on which it lay;
&#8220;there is my mark!&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Well done, brave Oseola!</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> That is just the way that he ought to
have acted.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> He was a very bold fellow. But what
did the generals say to him?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> His enemies, the whites, (for they were
enemies,) directly seized him, and bound him to a
tree. This was done in a cruel manner, for the
cords cut deep into his flesh. After this, he was
manacled and kept as a prisoner in solitary confinement.
When it was thought that his spirit
was sufficiently tamed, and that what he had suffered
would operate as a warning to his people,
he was set at liberty.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> The whites acted a cruel part, and they
ought to have been ashamed of themselves.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> Yes, indeed. But what did Oseola do
when he was free?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Revenge is dear to every one whose
heart God has not changed. No wonder that it
should burn in the bosom of an untaught Indian.
He had never heard the words of Holy Scripture,
&#8220;Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the
Lord,&#8221; Rom. xii. 19; but rather looked on revenge
as a virtue. Hasting to his companions,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
he made the forest echo with the wild war-whoop
that he raised in defiance of his enemies.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> I thought he would! That is the very
thing that I expected he would do.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Many of the principal whites fell by
the rifles of the Indians; and Oseola sent a proud
message to General Clinch, telling him that the
Seminoles had a hundred and fifty barrels of gunpowder,
every grain of which should be consumed
before they would submit to the whites. He told
him, too, that the pale faces should be led a dance
for five years for the indignities they had put upon
him. Oseola and the Seminoles maintained the
war until the whites had lost eighteen hundred
men, and expended vast sums of money. At
last, the brave chieftain was made prisoner by
treachery.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> How was it? How did they take him
prisoner?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The whites invited Oseola to meet
them, that a treaty might be made, and the war
brought to an end. Oseola went with his warriors;
but no sooner had he and eight of his warriors
placed their rifles against a tree, protected as
they thought by the flag of truce, than they were
surrounded by a large body of soldiers, and made
prisoners.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> That was an unjust and treacherous
act. Oseola ought to have kept away from them.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> And what did they do to Oseola? Did
they kill him?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> They at first confined him in the fort
at St. Augustine, and afterwards in a dungeon at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Sullivan&#8217;s Island, near Charleston. It was in the
latter place that he died, his head pillowed on the
faithful bosom of his wife, who never forsook
him, and never ceased to regard him with homage
and affection. He was buried at Fort Moultrie,
where he has a monument, inscribed &#8220;Oseola.&#8221;
His companions, had they been present at his
grave, would not have wept. They would have
been glad that he had escaped from his enemies.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Poor Oseola!</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> This is only one instance among thousands,
in which the red man has fallen a victim
to the treachery and injustice of the whites. It
is a solemn thought, that when the grave shall
give up its dead, and the trumpet shall call together,
face to face, the inhabitants of all nations
to judgment; the deceitful, the unjust and the
cruel will have to meet those whom their deceit,
their injustice and cruelty have destroyed. Well
may the oppressor tremble. &#8220;The Lord of hosts
hath purposed, and who shall disannul it? and his
hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it
back?&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> But you have not yet told us of Nikkanochee.
Please to let us hear all about him.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> Ay; we have forgotten Nikkanochee.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> I will now tell you all that I know of
him; but I thought you would like to hear of his
uncle, he being so famous a warrior. Nikkanochee
is called Oseola Nikkanochee, prince of
Econchatti, in order that he may bear in mind
Oseola, his warlike uncle, and also Econchatti-mico,
king of the Red Hills, his father. It is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
thought that Nikkanochee was born on the banks
of the river Chattahoochee. He can just remember
the death of his mother, when he was left
alone with her in a wigwam; but what I have to
tell you about Nikkanochee took place during the
lifetime of his father, and his uncle Oseola. The
white men being at war with the Seminoles, the
war-men of the latter were obliged to band themselves
together to fight, leaving their squaws and
children to travel as well as they could to a place
of safety. Nikkanochee, child as he was, travelled
with the women through the pine forests night
and day; but a party of horse-soldiers overtook
them, and drove them as captives towards the
settlements of the whites.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> Ay! now Nikkanochee is a prisoner!
What is to become of him now?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The mothers were almost frantic. The
wigwams they saw on the road had been destroyed
by fire, and the whole country had been devastated.
At nightfall they came to a village;
and here, when it grew dark, Nikkanochee, a
little girl and two Indian women made their
escape. For some days they fled, living on
water-melons and Indian corn, till they fell in
with a party of their own war-men, and among
them was Nikkanochee&#8217;s father.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> I hope they were safe then.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Not being numerous, they were obliged
to retreat. Pursued by their enemies, they fled,
sometimes on horseback, and sometimes on foot;
a part of the way through the swamps, thickets
and pine forests. At night, while the party were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
sitting round a fire, in the act of preparing for refreshment
some dried meat, and a wild root of the
woods reduced into flour, an alarm was given. In
a moment they were obliged once more to fly, for
their enemies were upon their track.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> Dreadful! dreadful!</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The fire was put out by the Indians,
their blankets hastily rolled up, and the squaws
and children sent to hide themselves in the tangled
reeds and brushwood of a swamp, while the war-men
turned against the enemy. The Indians beat
them off, but Econchatti-mico was wounded in
the wrist, a musket ball having passed through it.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> Did Econchatti die of his wound?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> No; but he and the war-men, expecting
that their enemies would return in greater
numbers, were again forced to fly. The dreary pine
forest, the weedy marsh, and the muddy swamp
were once more passed through. Brooks and
rapid rivers were crossed by Econchatti, wounded
as he was, with his son on his back. He swam
with one hand, for the other was of little use to
him.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Econchatti seems to be as brave a man
as Oseola. Did they escape from their enemies?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> While they were sitting down to partake
of some wild turkey and deer, with which
their bows and arrows had furnished them during
their flight, their enemies again fell upon them.
The Seminoles had, perhaps, altogether two thousand
warriors, with Oseola at their head; but
then the whites had at least ten thousand, to say
nothing of their being much better armed. No<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
wonder that the Seminoles were compelled to fly,
and only to fight when they found a favourable
opportunity. But I must not dwell longer than
necessary on my account; suffice it to say, that,
after all the bravery of the warriors, and all the
exertions of Econchatti, Nikkanochee once more
fell into the hands of the enemy.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> Oh, that was terrible! I hoped he
would get away safe.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> So did I. I thought the white men
would be tired of following them into those dreary
forests and muddy swamps.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> How was it that Nikkanochee was
taken?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> He was captured on the 25th of
August, 1836, by some soldiers who were scouring
the country, and brought by them the next day
to Colonel Warren. Poor little fellow, he was
so worn, emaciated and cast down, that he could
not be looked upon without pity. For several
weeks he hardly spoke a word. No tear, no sob,
nor sigh escaped him; but he appeared to be
continually on the watch to make his escape.
The soldiers who had taken him prisoner declared
that they had followed his track full forty miles
before they came up to him. From the rising to
the setting of the sun they hurried on, and still he
was before them. Nikkanochee must then have
been only about five or six years old.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> Why, I could not walk so far as forty
miles to save my life. How did he manage it?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> You have not been brought up like an
Indian. Fatigue and hardship and danger are endured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
by red men from their earliest infancy. The
back to the burden, Basil. You have heard the saying,
&#8220;God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb.&#8221;
When the soldiers came up to Nikkanochee, he
darted into the bushes and long grass, where
they found him. At first, he uttered a scream;
but, soon after, he offered the soldiers a peach
which he had in his hand, that they might let him
go. Placed on horseback behind one of the
troopers, he was brought to the military station.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> They have him now, then, fast enough.
I wonder what became of Econchatti-mico, his
father.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> That is not known. I should have
told you that, in the Seminole language, &#8220;Econ,&#8221;
means hill or hills; &#8220;Chatti,&#8221; is red; and the
signification of &#8220;mico,&#8221; is king: so that Econchatti-mico
is, all together, King of the Red Hills.
The soldiers who captured Nikkanochee disputed
among themselves whether he ought not to be
killed. Most of them were for destroying every
Indian man, woman, or child they met; but one
of them, named James Shields, was determined
to save the boy&#8217;s life, and it was owing to his
humanity that Nikkanochee was not put to death.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> That man deserves to be rewarded. I
shall not forget James Shields.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> When Nikkanochee had afterwards
become a little more reconciled to his situation,
he gave some account of the way in which he
was taken. He said, that as he was travelling
with his father and the Indians, the white men
came upon them. According to Indian custom,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
when a party is surprised, the women and children
immediately fly in different directions, to hide in
the bushes and long grass, till the war-men return
to them after the fight or alarm is over. Poor
little Nikkanochee, in trying to cross a rivulet,
fell back again into it. Besides this misfortune,
he met with others, so that he could not keep up
with the party. He still kept on, for he saw an
old coffee-pot placed on a log; and Indians, in
their flight, place things in their track, and also
break off twigs from the bushes, that others of
their tribe may know how to follow them. Nikkanochee
came to a settlement of whites, but he
struck out of the road to avoid it. He afterwards
entered a peach orchard, belonging to a deserted
house, and here he satisfied his hunger. It was
then getting dark, but the soldiers saw him, and
set off after him at full gallop. In vain he hid
himself in the grass, and lay as still as a partridge,
for they discovered him and took him away.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> I wonder that Econchatti-mico, his
father, or the brave Oseola, his uncle, did not
rescue him.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> It is thought that they did return upon
the back trail, for the place they had been in was
shortly after surrounded by Indians, with Oseola
at their head; but just then a reinforcement of
soldiers arrived, and the Indians were obliged to
retire. Had not the soldiers come up just in
time, the whole garrison might have fallen by the
rifles and scalping-knives of enraged Seminoles.
Nikkanochee passed a year with the family of
Colonel Warren, and was beloved by them all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
There was, no doubt, much sympathy felt for
him, as the nephew of a well-known warrior, and
the son of the king of a warlike people. Nikkanochee
was afterwards taken under the protection
of a gentleman, who became much attached
to him. He was educated with other children,
and taught to bend the knee in prayer, and to
offer praise to the King of kings and Lord of
lords. Thus, in the providence of God, was
Nikkanochee brought from being a heathen to
be a worshipper of the true God and Jesus Christ.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> How much longer did he remain abroad?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> A very few years, during which he
became expert in climbing, swimming, loading
the rifle, and using the spear. He was bold
enough to attack the raccoon and otter, and was
not afraid even of the alligator; few of his age
were more hardy, or could bear an equal degree
of fatigue. His kind protector, who adopted him
as his own child, took him over to England in
the year 1840. But I have given you a long
account. May Nikkanochee become as celebrated
for virtue and piety as his ancestors and relations
were for valour and war.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the next visit of the three brothers to the
hunter, he pointed out to them the great influence
that religion had on the character of any people or
country. A false religion brings with it a train
of unnumbered evils; while a knowledge of the
true God, and a living faith in the Saviour who
died for sinners, continually promote among mankind
principles of justice and kindness, and communicate
to their hearts the blessings of peace
and joy. &#8220;True it is,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that among
professedly Christian people there is much of evil;
much of envy, hatred, malice, uncharitableness;
of injustice, covetousness and cruelty. But this
proceeds not from Christianity, but from the fallen
state of human nature, which nothing but the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
grace of God can renew, and from the great number
of those who profess to be Christians, while
they are uninfluenced by the gospel of the Redeemer.
Christianity will neither allow us to dishonour
God by bowing down to idols, nor to injure
man by injustice and oppression. The Indians
of our country are not found bowing down
to numberless idols, as the inhabitants of many
countries are: they worship what they call &#8216;the
Great Spirit,&#8217; with a deep reverence, humbling
themselves before him, and undergoing self-imposed
torments, to gain his good will, which the
generality of Christians, in the manifestation of
their faith, would find it hard to endure. They
believe also in an Evil Spirit, as well as in a future
state; and that they shall be happy or unhappy,
just as they have done good or evil, according
to their estimate of those qualities, but
this belief is mixed up with mysteries and superstitions
without number. I speak of Indians in
the forest and the prairie, who know nothing
of God&#8217;s word, and who have never heard the
voice of a missionary.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The different tribes believe, that if
they are expert in the chase, bold in battle, and
slay many of their enemies, they shall live for
ever, after death, in beautiful hunting-grounds,
enjoying the pleasures of the chase continually.
You know that we, as Christians, are enjoined to
forgive our enemies; but untutored Indians delight
in revenge: they love to boast, and to shed
blood; but we are taught, by God&#8217;s holy word,
to be humble and merciful. There is one thing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
that mingles much with the Indian character; and
that is, medicine, or mystery. I must try to make
you understand it.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Yes; I should like to know all about
it very well.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Go where you may, among the Choctaws,
the Seminoles, the Crows, or the Blackfeet,
every Indian has his medicine or mystery bag,
which he regards with reverence, and will not
part with for any price. He looks upon it as a
kind of charm, or guardian spirit, that is to keep
him from evil. He takes it with him to battle,
and when he dies it is his companion.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> But what is it? Is there any thing in
the bag? What is it that makes medicine?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Every thing that is mysterious or
wonderful to an Indian, he regards as medicine.
I do not mean such medicine as we get from an
apothecary; but he regards it as something awful,
and connected with spirits. This is a strong
superstition, which has laid hold of the red man
throughout the whole of his race.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> But is there any thing in the medicine
bag?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The medicine bag is usually the skin
of some animal, such as the beaver, otter, polecat,
or weazel; or of some bird, as the eagle, the
magpie, or hawk; or of some reptile, as the snake
or the toad. This skin is stuffed with any thing
the owner chooses to put into it, such as dry
grass, or leaves; and it is carefully sewed up into
some curious form, and ornamented in a curious
manner. Some medicine bags are very large,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
and form a conspicuous part of an Indian&#8217;s appendages;
while others are very small, and
altogether hidden.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> Why, it is very foolish in the red men
to carry such things about with them.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> It certainly is so; but their fathers
and their tribes have done so for many generations,
and it would be a disgrace to them, in their own
estimation, if they neglected to do the same. A
young Indian, before he has his medicine bag,
goes perhaps alone on the prairie, or wanders in
the forest, or beside some solitary lake. Day
after day, and night after night, he fasts, and calls
on the Great Spirit to help him to medicine. When
he sleeps, the first animal, or bird, or reptile that
he dreams of, is his medicine. If it be a weazel,
he catches a weazel, and it becomes his medicine
for ever. If it be a toad or snake, he kills it;
and if it be a bird, he shoots it, and stuffs its
skin.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> This is one of the most wonderful
things you have told us yet.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> What is called a medicine man, or a
mystery man, is one who ranks high in his tribe
for some supposed knowledge. He can either
make buffaloes come, or cure disease, or bring
rain, or do some other wonderful things, or persuade
his tribe that he can do them. Indeed,
among Indians, hardly any thing is done without
the medicine man. A chief, in full dress, would
as soon think of making his appearance without
his head as without his medicine bag. There is
a saying among the Indians, that &#8220;a man lying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
down, is medicine to the grizzly bear;&#8221; meaning,
that in such a position a bear will not hurt him.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> Is it true? Will not the grizzly bear
hurt a man when he is lying down?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> So many people say; but I should be
very sorry to trust the grizzly bear. I am afraid
that he would be paying his respects to me in a
very rough way.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> What was it that you said about the
medicine man bringing rain?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Some of them are famous for bringing
rain in a dry season.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> But they cannot really bring rain.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The matter is managed in this way.&mdash;When
once they undertake to bring rain, they
keep up their superstitious ceremonies, day after
day, till the rain comes. Oftentimes it is very
long before they succeed. It was in a time of
great drought, that I once arrived at the Mandan
village on the Upper Missouri. At the different
Indian villages, peas and beans, wild rice, corn,
melons, squashes, pumpkins, peaches and strawberries
were often found in abundance; but, on
this occasion, the Mandans had a very poor prospect
of gathering any thing that required rain to
bring it to perfection. The young and the old
were crying out that they should have no green
corn.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Why did they not tell the medicine
men earlier to make the rain come?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> They did so: but it was not quite convenient
to the medicine men; for they saw clearly
enough that there was not the slightest appearance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
of rain. After putting it off, day after day, the
sky grew a little cloudy to the west, when the
medicine men assembled together in great haste
to make it rain.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> Ay! they were very cunning.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> No sooner was it known that the medicine
men were met together in the mystery lodge,
than the village was all in commotion. They
wanted rain, and they were very sure that their
medicine men could bring it when they pleased.
The tops of the wigwams were soon crowded. In
the mystery lodge a fire was kindled, round which
sat the rain-makers, burning sweet-smelling herbs,
smoking the medicine pipe, and calling on the
Great Spirit to open the door of the skies, and let
out the rain.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> That is the way they make it rain, is it?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> At last, one of the rain-makers came
out of the mystery lodge, and stood on the top of
it with a spear in his hand, which he brandished
about in a commanding and threatening manner,
lifting it up as though he were about to hurl it up
at the heavens. He talked aloud of the power
of his medicine, holding up his medicine bag in
one hand, and his spear in the other; but it was
of no use, neither his medicine nor his spear could
make it rain; and, at the setting of the sun, he
came down from his elevated position in disgrace.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Poor fellow! He had had enough of
rain-making for one day.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> For several days the same ceremony
was carried on, until a rain-maker, with a head-dress<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
of the skins of birds, ascended the top of
the mystery lodge, with a bow in his hand, and a
quiver at his back. He made a long speech,
which had in it much about thunder and lightning,
and black clouds and drenching rain; for the sky
was growing dark, and it required no great knowledge
of the weather to foretell rain. He shot
arrows to the east and west, and others to the
north and the south, in honour of the Great Spirit
who could send the rain from all parts of the skies.
A fifth arrow he retained, until it was almost certain
that rain was at hand. Then, sending up
the shaft from his bow, with all his might, to
make a hole, as he said, in the dark cloud over
his head, he cried aloud for the waters to pour
down at his bidding, and to drench him to the skin.
He was brandishing his bow in one hand, and his
medicine in the other, when the rain came down
in a torrent. The whole village was clamorous
with applause. He was regarded as a great mystery
man, whose medicine was very powerful, and he
rose to great distinction among his tribe. You
see, then, the power of a mystery man in bringing
rain. Does it not astonish you?</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> No, not a bit. I see that it was all a
cheat.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> I could make it rain myself as well as
he did, for he never shot his arrow to pierce the
cloud till it was over his head.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> To be a mystery man is regarded as a
great honour; and some Indians are said to have
suspended themselves from a pole, with splints
through their flesh, and their medicine bags in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
their hands, looking towards the sun, for a whole
day, to obtain it.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> When I go among the Indians, I will
not be a mystery man.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Now I will tell you something about
Indian marriages. There is very little ceremony
in an Indian marriage. The father may be seen
sitting among his friends, when the young Indian
comes in with presents, to induce him to give him
his daughter for a wife. If the presents are not
liked, they are not accepted; if they are approved,
the father takes the hand of his daughter, and the
hand of the young Indian, and slaps them together;
after which a little feasting takes place.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Why, that is like buying a wife.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> It is; but the young Indian has already
gained the good will of his intended wife: not by
his fine clothes and his wealth, for he has neither
the one nor the other, but by showing her the
skins of the bears he has killed, and the scalps
and scalp-locks of the foes he has slaughtered;
and by telling her that he will hunt for her, that
she may be kept from want, and fight for her, that
she may be protected from the enemies of her
tribe. Indians have strange customs: some flatten
the heads of their young children, by laying them
in a cradle, with a pillow for the back of the
head, and then pressing the forehead, day after
day, with a board, that comes down upon it, till
the nose and forehead form a straight line.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> I should not like my head to be flattened
in that manner.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Children are carried about in their
cradles on the backs of their mothers, wherever
they go; and when children die, they are often
left, in their cradles, floating on the water of a
brook or pool, which their superstition teaches
them to regard as sacred. A cluster of these little
arks or cradles, or coffins as they may be called,
of different forms, in a lone pool, is a very picturesque
and affecting sight.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> I shall often think of the pool, and the
little cradles swimming on it. It would remind
me of Moses in the bulrushes.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> There are other singular customs
among the Indians. The Kowyas, the Pawnees,
the Sacs and Foxes, the Osages, and the Iowas,
all shave their heads, leaving a tuft on the crown
two or three inches in length, and a small lock in
the middle of it, as long as they can make it grow.
By means of this small lock of hair braided, they
ornament the tuft with a crest of the deer&#8217;s tail
dyed scarlet, and sometimes add to it a war-eagle&#8217;s
feather.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> How different from the Crow Indians!
They do not shave off their hair; but let it grow
till it hangs down to the very ground.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> You have not forgotten that, I see.
There is a cruel custom among the Indians, of
exposing their aged people, that is, leaving them
alone to die. If a party are obliged to remove
from one place to another in search of food, and
there is among them an aged man, who can no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
longer fight, nor hunt, nor fish, nor do any thing
to support himself, he is liable, although in his
time he may have been a war-chief, to be left
alone to die. I have seen such a one sitting by a
little fire left him by his tribe, with perhaps a buffalo
skin stretched on poles over his head, and a
little water and a few bones within his reach. I
have put my pipe to his mouth, given him pemican,
and gathered sticks, that he might be able to
recruit his fire; and when, months after, I have
returned to the spot, there has been nothing left
of him but his skeleton, picked clean by the
wolves and bleaching in the winds.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> This is one of the worst things we have
heard of the Indians.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> Oh, it is very sad indeed!</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> You would not forsake your father, in
old age, in that manner, would you?</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> No! As long as we could get a bit of
bread or a drop of water, he should have part of
it, and we would die with him rather than desert
him.</p>

<p><i>Brian</i> and <i>Basil.</i> Yes; that we would!</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> I hope so. This is, I say, a cruel custom;
but it forms a part of Indian manners, so
that the old men expect it, and, indeed, would
not alter it. Indians have not been taught, as we
have, to honour their parents, at least not in the
same way; but I can say nothing in favour of so
cruel and unnatural a custom. Among the Sioux
of the Mississippi, it is considered great medicine
to jump on the Leaping Rock, and back again.
This rock is a huge column or block, between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
thirty and forty feet high, divided from the side
of the Red Pipe-stone Quarry. It is about seven
feet broad, and at a distance from the main rock
of about six or eight feet. Many are bold enough
to take the leap, and to leave their arrows sticking
in one of its crevices; while others, equally
courageous, have fallen from the top in making
the attempt, and been dashed to pieces.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> When you go to Pipe-stone Quarry,
Austin, have nothing to do with the Leaping
Rock. You must get your medicine in some
other way.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> I shall leave the Leaping Rock to the
leaping Indians, for it will never suit me.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> There is a very small fish caught in
the river Thames, called white bait, which is
considered a very great luxury; but, to my taste,
the white fish, of which the Chippewas take great
abundance in the rapids near the Falls of St.
Mary&#8217;s, are preferable. The Chippewas catch
them in the rapids with scoop-nets, in the use of
which they are very expert. The white fish
resemble salmon, but are much less in size.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> The white fish of the Chippewas will
suit me better than the Leaping Rock of the
Sioux.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Among the Indians, feasting, fasting,
and sacrifices of a peculiar kind, form a part of
their religious or superstitious observances. Some
of the Pawnees, in former times, offered human
sacrifices; but this cruel custom is now no more.
The Mandans frequently offered a finger to the
god, or Evil Spirit; and most of the tribes offer a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
horse, a dog, a spear, or an arrow, as the case
may be. Over the Mandan mystery lodge used
to hang the skin of a white buffalo, with blue and
black cloth of great value. These were intended
as a sacrifice or an offering to the good and evil
spirits, to avert their anger and to gain their
favour.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> How many things you do remember!</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> All the chiefs of the tribes keep runners:
men swift of foot, who carry messages and
commands, and spread among the people news
necessary to be communicated. These runners
sometimes go great distances in a very short space
of time.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> You must have your runners, Austin.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Oh yes, I will have my runners: for
I shall want pipe-stone from Red Pipe-stone
Quarry, and white fish from the Chippewas; and
then I shall send messages to the Cherokees and
Choctaws, the Camanchees, the Blackfeet and
the Crows.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The squaws, or wives of the Indians,
labour very contentedly, seeming to look on servitude
as their proper calling. They get in wood
and water; they prepare the ground for grain,
cook victuals, make the dresses of their husbands,
manufacture pottery, dress skins, attend to the
children, and make themselves useful in a hundred
other ways.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> I think the squaws behave themselves
very well.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The smoking of the pipe takes place<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
on all great occasions, just as though the Indians
thought it was particularly grateful to the Good
and Evil Spirits. In going to war, or in celebrating
peace, as well as on all solemn occasions,
the pipe is smoked. Oftentimes, before it is
passed round, the stem is pointed upwards, and
then offered to the four points&mdash;east, west, north
and south. In the hands of a mystery man, it is
great and powerful medicine. If ever you go
among the red men, you must learn to smoke;
for to refuse to draw a whiff through the friendly
pipe offered to you, would be regarded as a sad
affront.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> What will you do now, Austin? You
never smoked a pipe in your life.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Oh, I should soon learn; besides, I
need only take a very little whiff.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> You must learn to eat dog&#8217;s flesh,
too; for when the Indians mean to confer a great
honour on a chief or a stranger, they give him a
dog feast, in which they set before him their most
favourite dogs, killed and cooked. The more useful
the dogs were, and the more highly valued,
the greater is the compliment to him in whose
honour the feast is given; and if he were to refuse
to eat of the dog&#8217;s flesh, thus prepared out
of particular respect to him, no greater offence
could be offered to his hospitable entertainers.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> You have something a little harder to
do now, I think, Austin; to learn to eat dog&#8217;s
flesh.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> You may depend upon it, that I shall
keep out of the way of a dog feast. I might take<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
a little whiff at their pipe, but I could not touch
their dainty dogs.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> In some of the large lodges, I have
seen very impressive common life-scenes. Fancy
to yourselves a large round lodge, holding ten or
a dozen beds of buffalo skins, with a high post
between every bed. On these posts hang the
shields, the war-clubs, the spears, the bows and
quivers, the eagle-plumed head-dresses, and the
medicine bags of the different Indians who sleep
there; and on the top of each post the buffalo
mask, with its horns and tail, used in the buffalo
dance. Fancy to yourselves a group of Indians in
the middle of the lodge, with their wives and their
little ones around them, smoking their pipes and
relating their adventures, as happy as ease and the
supply of all their animal wants can make them.
While you gaze on the scene, so strange, so wild,
so picturesque and so happy, an emotion of friendly
feeling for the red man thrills your bosom, a tear
of pleasure starts into your eye; and, before you
are aware, an ejaculation of thankfulness has
escaped your lips, to the Father of mercies, that,
in his goodness and bounty to mankind, he has
not forgotten the inhabitants of the forest and the
prairie.</p>

<p>The Indians have a method of hardening their
shields, by smoking them over a fire, in a hole in
the ground; and, usually, when a warrior thus
smokes his shield, he gives a feast to his friends.
Some of the pipes of the Indians are beautiful.
The bowls are all of the red stone from Pipe-stone
Quarry, cut into all manner of fantastic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
forms; while the stems, three or four feet long, are
ornamented with braids of porcupine&#8217;s quills,
beaks of birds, feathers and red hair. The calumet,
or, as it is called, &#8220;the peace-pipe,&#8221; is indeed,
as I have before said, great medicine. It
is highly adorned with quills of the war-eagle,
and never used on any other occasion than that of
making and solemnizing peace, when it is passed
round to the chiefs. It is regarded as altogether
a sacred utensil. An Indian&#8217;s pipe is his friend
through the pains and pleasures of life; and when
his tomahawk and his medicine bag are placed
beside his poor, pallid remains, his pipe is not
forgotten.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> When an Indian dies, how do they
bury him?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> According to the custom of his tribe.
Some Indians are buried under the sod; some are
left in cots, or cradles, on the water; and others
are placed on frames raised to support them.
You remember that I told you of Blackbird&#8217;s
grave.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Ay! he was buried on horseback, on
the top of a high bluff, sitting on his horse. He
was covered all over with sods.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> And I told you of the Chinock children
floating on the solitary pool.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> Yes, I remember them very well.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Grown-up Chinocks are left floating
in cradles, just in the same manner; though oftener
they are tied up in skins, and laid in canoes, with
paddles, pipes and provisions, and then hoisted
up into a tree, and left there to decay. In the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Mandan burial place, the dead were ranged in
rows, on high slender frames, out of the way of
the wolf, dressed in their best robes, and wrapped
in a fresh buffalo skin, with all their arms, pipes,
and every necessary provision and comfort to supply
their wants in their journey to the hunting-grounds
of their fathers. In our burial grounds,
there are generally some monuments grander than
the rest, to set forth the wealth, the station, or the
talents of those who slumber below; and, as human
nature is the same everywhere, so in the resting
place of the Indians. Here and there are
spread out a few yards of red or blue cloth, to signify
that beneath it a chief, or a superior brave, is
sleeping. The Mandan dead occupied a spot on
the prairie. Here they mouldered, warrior lying
by the side of warrior, till they fell to the ground
from their frames, when the bones were buried,
and the skulls ranged with great care, in round
rings, on the prairie, with two buffalo skulls and
a medicine pole in the centre.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Ay! it would be of no use for the
wolf to come then, for there would be nothing for
him. I should very much like to see an Indian
burying-place.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Were you to visit one, you would see
that the heart and affections are at work under a
red skin, as well as under a white one; for parents
and children, husbands and wives, go there to lament
for those who are dear to them, and to humble
themselves before the Great Spirit, under
whose care they believe their departed relatives
to be. The skulls, too, are visited, and every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
one is placed carefully, from time to time, on a
tuft of sweet-smelling herb or plant. Life is but
a short season with both the white and the red
man, and ought to be well spent. It is as a flower
that flourishes: &#8220;For the wind passeth over it,
and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know
it no more.&#8221; But I have now told you enough
for the present. Come again, as soon as you will;
I shall have some anecdotes of Indians ready for
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> willing feet, sparkling eyes and happy
hearts, Austin and his two brothers again set off
for the cottage near the wood. On an ordinary
occasion, they might have found time for a little
pleasant loitering; but the Indian anecdotes they
expected to hear excited their curiosity too much
to allow a single minute to be lost. A pin might
have been heard falling on the ground, when,
seated in the cottage, they listened to the following
anecdotes of the hunter.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> It has pleased God to endue Indians
with quick perceptions. They are amazingly
quick in tracing an enemy, both in the woods and
the prairie. A broken twig or leaf, or the faintest
impression on the grass, is sufficient to attract their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
attention. The anecdotes I am about to relate are
believed to be true, but I cannot myself vouch
for their correctness, having only read them, or
heard them related by others.</p>

<p>An Indian, upon his return home to his hut
one day, discovered that his venison, which had
been hung up to dry, had been stolen. After going
some distance, he met some persons, of whom
he inquired if they had seen a <i>little, old, white
man</i>, with a short gun, and accompanied by a small
dog with a bob-tail. They replied in the affirmative;
and, upon the Indian&#8217;s assuring them that
the man thus described had stolen his venison,
they desired to be informed how he was able
to give such a minute description of a person
whom he had not seen. The Indian answered
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;The thief I know is a <i>little</i> man, by his having
made a pile of stones in order to reach the
venison, from the height I hung it standing on the
ground; that he is an <i>old</i> man, I know by his
short steps, which I have traced over the dead
leaves in the woods; that he is a <i>white</i> man, I
know by his turning out his toes when he walks,
which an Indian never does; his gun I know to
be short, by the mark which the muzzle made by
rubbing the bark of the tree on which it leaned;
that the dog is small, I know by his tracks; and
that he has a bob-tail, I discovered by the mark
of it in the dust where he was sitting at the time
his master was taking down the meat.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> Well done, Indian! Why, nothing
could escape a man like that.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> An Englishman would hardly have
been able to describe the thief without seeing
him.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> You shall have another instance of the
quick perceptions of the red men. A most atrocious
and shocking murder was once committed,
by a party of Indians, on fourteen white settlers,
within five miles of Shamokin. The surviving
whites, in their rage, determined to take their revenge
by murdering a Delaware Indian, who happened
to be in those parts, and who was far from
thinking himself in any danger. He was a great
friend to the whites, was loved and esteemed by
them, and, in testimony of their regard, had received
from them the name of Duke Holland, by
which he was generally known.</p>

<p>This Indian, satisfied that his nation were incapable
of committing such a foul murder in a
time of profound peace, told the enraged settlers
that he was sure the Delawares were not in any
manner concerned in it, and that it was the act
of some wicked Mingoes or Iroquois, whose custom
it was to involve other nations in wars with
each other, by secretly committing murders, so
that they might appear to be the work of others.
But all his representations were vain; he could
not convince exasperated men, whose minds were
fully bent on revenge.</p>

<p>At last, he offered that, if they would give him
a party to accompany him, he would go with
them in quest of the murderers, and was sure that
he could discover them by the prints of their feet,
and other marks well known to him, by which he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
would convince them that the real perpetrators of
the crime belonged to the Six Nations.</p>

<p>His proposal was accepted. He marched at
the head of a party of whites and led them into the
tracks. They soon found themselves in the most
rocky part of a mountain, where not one of those
who accompanied him could discover a single
track, nor would they believe that men had ever
trodden on this ground, as they had to jump from
rock to rock, or to crawl over them. They began
to believe that the Indian had led them across
these rugged mountains in order to give the enemy
time to escape. They threatened him with instant
death the moment they should be convinced of
the fraud.</p>

<p>The Indian, true to his promise, took pains to
make them perceive that an enemy had passed
along the places through which he was leading
them. Here, he showed them that the moss on
the road had been trodden down by the weight
of a human foot; there, that it had been torn and
dragged forward from its place. Again, he would
point out to them, that pebbles, or small stones
on the rocks, had been removed from their beds
by the foot hitting against them; that dry sticks,
by being trodden upon, were broken; and, in
one particular place, that an Indian&#8217;s blanket had
been dragged over the rocks, and had removed
or loosened the leaves lying there, so that they
did not lie flat, as in other places. All these
marks the Indian could perceive as he walked
along, without even stopping.</p>

<p>At last, arriving at the foot of the mountain, on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
soft ground, where the tracks were deep, he found
that the enemy were eight in number; and, from
the freshness of the foot-prints, he concluded that
they must be encamped at no great distance.</p>

<p>This proved to be the exact truth; for, after
gaining the eminence on the other side of the valley,
the Indians were seen encamped: some
having already laid down to sleep, while others
were drawing off their leggings, or Indian stockings,
for the same purpose, and the scalps they
had taken were hanging up to dry.</p>

<p>&#8220;See,&#8221; said Duke Holland to his astonished
companions, &#8220;there is the enemy; not people of
my nation, but Mingoes, as I truly told you. They
are in our power. In less than half an hour they
will be all fast asleep. We need not fire a gun,
but go up and tomahawk them. We are nearly
two to one, and need apprehend no danger.
Come on, and you will now have your full revenge.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the whites, overcome with fear, did not
choose to follow the Indian&#8217;s advice, but desired
him to take them back by the nearest and best
way. This he did; and when they arrived at
home, they reported the enemy to have been so
great that they durst not venture to attack them.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> This instance is quite as wonderful as
the other.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> I would not have an Indian after me if
I had done wrong; for he would be sure to find
me out.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Red men often act very conscientiously.
One day, an Indian solicited a little tobacco<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
of a white man, to fill his pipe. Having
some loose in his pocket, the white man gave him
a handful. The next day the Indian returned in
search of the man who had given him the tobacco.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish to see him,&#8221; said the Indian.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why so?&#8221; inquired some one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I find money with the tobacco.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well! what of that? Keep it; it was given
to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said the Indian, shaking his head, &#8220;I
got good man and bad man here,&#8221; pointing to his
breast. &#8220;Good man say, &#8216;Money not yours; you
must return it:&#8217; bad man say, &#8216;<i>&#8217;Tis</i> yours; it was
given to you.&#8217; Good man say, &#8216;That not right:
<i>tobacco</i> yours, <i>money</i> not yours.&#8217; Bad man say,
&#8216;Never mind, nobody know it; go buy rum.&#8217;
Good man say, &#8216;Oh no; no such thing.&#8217; So
poor Indian know not what to do. Me lie down
to sleep, but no sleep; good man and bad man
talk all night, and trouble me. So now, me
bring money back: now, me feel good.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> I like that Indian very much.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> No one could have acted more honestly.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Whatever the Indians may be, when
oppressed, wronged and deceived by the whites;
and however they may act towards their enemies;
they are usually honest towards their own tribe.
While I was residing on the Big Beaver, says
one who lived much among them, I passed by
the door of an Indian who was a trader, and had,
consequently, a quantity of goods in his house.
He was going with his wife to Pittsburg, and
they were shutting up the house; as no person<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
remained in it during their absence. This shutting
up was nothing else than putting a large
block, with a few sticks of wood, outside against
the door, so as to keep it closed. As I was looking
at this man with attention, while he was so
employed, he addressed me in these words:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;See, my friend, this is an Indian lock that I
am putting to my door.&#8221;</p>

<p>I answered, &#8220;Well enough; but I see you
leave much property in the house: are you not
afraid that those articles will be stolen while you
are gone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stolen! by whom?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, by Indians, to be sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; replied he, &#8220;no Indian would do
such a thing. Unless a white man, or white people,
should happen to come this way, I shall find
all safe on my return.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> If we were to leave our doors in that
way, our houses would be sure to be robbed.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> No doubt they would; but Indians
have good and bad qualities. The notion entertained
by the Iroquois Indians, respecting the
creation of mankind, will show how ignorant they
are with respect to the Creator of all things; but,
indeed, if the blessed book of truth were not in
our hands, we should be equally ignorant ourselves.
Before man existed, say they, there were
three great and good spirits; of whom one was
superior to the other two, and is emphatically
called the Great Spirit and the Good Spirit. At
a certain time, this exalted being said to one of
the others, &#8220;Make a man.&#8221; He obeyed; and,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
taking chalk, formed a paste of it, and moulding
it into the human form, infused into it the animating
principle, and brought it to the Great
Spirit. He, after surveying it, said, &#8220;This is too
white.&#8221;</p>

<p>He then directed the other to make a trial of
his skill. Accordingly, taking charcoal, he pursued
the same process, and brought the result to
the Great Spirit; who, after surveying it, said,
&#8220;It is too black.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then said the Great Spirit, &#8220;I will now try
myself;&#8221; and taking red earth, he formed an Indian.
On surveying it, he said, &#8220;This is a proper
or perfect man.&#8221;</p>

<p>After relating the strange opinion of the Iroquois
Indians, the hunter advised the young people, on
their return home, to look over the account of the
creation of the world and mankind, in the first
chapter of Genesis; telling them that they could
not be too thankful for the opportunity of reading
God&#8217;s word, which was not only sufficient to
keep them from error in such things, but was able
also to make them &#8220;wise unto salvation through
faith which is in Christ Jesus.&#8221; He told them,
that though the Indians were ignorant of holy
things, they did not want shrewdness and sagacity.
&#8220;When General Lincoln,&#8221; said he, &#8220;went to
make peace with the Creek Indians, one of the
chiefs asked him to sit down on a log; he was
then desired to move, and, in a few minutes, to
move still farther. The request was repeated,
until the general got to the end of the log. The
Indian still said, &#8216;Move farther;&#8217; to which the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
general replied, &#8216;I can move no farther.&#8217; &#8216;Just
so it is with us,&#8217; said the chief. &#8216;You have
moved us back to the water, and then ask us to
move farther!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>In the account of his expedition to the foot of
the Rocky Mountains, in 1821, Major Long relates
the following anecdote of a Pawnee brave,
son of Red Knife, who, in the succeeding winter,
visited the city of Washington, during the session
of Congress.</p>

<p>This brave, of fine size, figure and countenance,
is now about twenty-five years old. At
the age of twenty-one, his heroic deeds had acquired
for him in his nation the rank of the bravest
of the braves. The savage practice of torturing
and burning to death their prisoners existed in
this nation. An unfortunate female, of the Paduca
nation, taken in war, was destined to this horrid
death.</p>

<p>The fatal hour had arrived. The trembling
victim, far from her home and her friends, was
fastened to the stake. The whole tribe were assembled
on the surrounding plains to witness the
awful scene.</p>

<p>Just as the funeral pile was to be kindled, and
the whole multitude of spectators were on the
tiptoe of expectation, this young warrior, having,
unnoticed, prepared two fleet horses, with the necessary
provisions, sprang from his seat, rushed
through the crowd, liberated the victim, seized
her in his arms, placed her on one of the horses,
mounted the other himself, and made the utmost
speed towards the nation and friends of the captive.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>The multitude, dumb and nerveless with amazement
at the daring deed, made no effort to rescue
their victim from her deliverer. They viewed
it as the immediate act of the Great Spirit, submitted
to it without a murmur, and quietly retired
to their village.</p>

<p>The released captive was accompanied three
days through the wilderness, towards her home.
Her deliverer then gave her the horse on which
she rode, and the necessary provisions for the
remainder of the journey, and they parted.</p>

<p>On his return to the village, such was his popularity,
that no inquiry was made into his conduct,
and no censure was passed upon it. Since
this transaction no human sacrifice has been
offered in this or any other of the Pawnee tribes;
the practice is abandoned. How influential is one
bold act in a good cause! This deed illustrates
a grand principle, boys. It is by such men that
great reformations are made in the world, and
yet there is no mastery in it. Every one is capable
of doing that which he knows to be right, regardless
of the opinions of wicked men, or the
habits of the weak and foolish, who follow customs
which have no apology but that others have done
so before.</p>

<p>The publication of this anecdote at Washington
led some young ladies, in a manner highly
creditable to their good sense and good feeling, to
present this brave and humane Indian with a
handsome silver medal, with appropriate inscriptions,
as a token of their sincere commendation
of the noble act of rescuing one of their sex,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
an innocent victim, from a cruel death. Their
address, delivered on this occasion, is sensible
and appropriate, closing as follows:</p>

<p>&#8220;Brother&mdash;Accept this token of our esteem;
always wear it for our sakes; and when again you
have the power to save a poor woman from death
and torture, think of this, and of us, and fly to her
relief and rescue.&#8221;</p>

<p>To this the Pawnee made the following reply:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Brothers and sisters&mdash;This medal will give me
ease more than I ever had; and I will listen more
than I ever did to white men.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad that my brothers and sisters have
heard of the good deed that I have done. My
brothers and sisters think that I have done it in
ignorance, but I now know what I have done.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did do it in ignorance, and I did not know
that I did good; but by your giving me this medal
I know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cruelty of torturing and burning a captive,
the great danger of the female Indian, and the
noble daring of the Pawnee brave, formed the
subject of conversation for some time among the
young people; and Austin was unbounded in his
approbation of the Pawnee. Willingly would he
have contributed towards another silver medal for
him, and Brian and Basil would not have been
backward in doing their part; but the affair appeared
hardly practicable, inasmuch as a reasonable
doubt existed whether the Pawnee brave
was still alive; and, even if he were, there seemed
to be no direct way of communicating with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Remember</span>,&#8221; said Austin, as he urged his
brothers to quicken their pace on their way to the
cottage, &#8220;we have hardly heard any thing yet
about buffaloes and grizzly bears, and other animals
which are found in the woods and the
prairie. Let us make haste, that we may have a
long visit.&#8221;</p>

<p>Brian and Basil, being almost as anxious as
their brother to hear all about bears and buffaloes,
quickened their pace as he desired them, so that
no long period had passed, before the hunter, at
the request of his youthful visitors, was engaged
in giving them the desired account.</p>

<p>&#8220;The different animals and birds,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;that inhabit different countries, for the most part,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
roam backwards and forwards, according to the
season. Creatures that love the cold move northerly
in summer, and such as delight in a warmer
clime move southerly in winter. It is, however,
principally to obtain food that they remove from
one place to another. I must here explain to you,
that though I have, in common with most others
who use these terms, spoken of buffaloes, the
animal which abounds in the prairie is not properly
the buffalo, but the bison.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> But if they are bisons, why are they
called buffaloes?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> That is a question that I hardly know
how to answer. From whatever cause it may
have arisen, certain it is, that the name of buffalo
has become common; and, that being the case,
it is used in conversation, and oftentimes in books,
as being more easily understood.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> What is the difference between a buffalo
and a bison?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> A buffalo is an animal that abounds
in Africa, resembling an ugly cow, with a body
long, but rather low; and very long horns. But
the bison stands very high in front, has a hump
on the back part of the neck covered with long
hair, short horns, and a profusion of long shaggy
hair hanging from its head, neck and fore-legs.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Then a bison must look much fiercer
than a buffalo.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> He does; and from the circumstance
of his fore-parts standing high, while he carries
his head low, he always appears as if he were
about to run at you. Bisons abound throughout<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the whole of our country, west of the Mississippi;
but the reckless way in which they are
slaughtered, and the spread of civilization, are
likely, in a few years, greatly to decrease their
numbers. Indians suffer much from hunger, but
they are very reckless when buffaloes are plentiful.
On one occasion, when among the Minatarees,
I witnessed a grand capture of buffaloes. It
was effected by different parties taking different
directions, and then gradually approaching each
other. The herd was thus hemmed in on all sides,
and the slaughter was terrible. The unerring
rifle, the sharp spear and the winged arrow, had
full employ; and so many buffaloes were slain,
that, after taking their tongues and other choice
parts of them for food, hundreds of carcasses were
left for the prairie-wolves to devour. Thus it is
that man, whether savage or civilized, too often
becomes prodigal of the abundance he enjoys, and
knows not the value of what he possesses, till
taught by that want into which his thoughtless
waste has plunged him.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Ay, they will soon kill all the buffaloes,
if they go on in that manner.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> At present, they are to be seen on the
prairie in droves of many thousands; the woods,
also, abound with them; and often, in the heat of
summer, an incalculable number of heads and
horns are visible in the rivers, the bodies of the
bisons being under the water.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> What, because they are so hot?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Yes: the bison suffers very much from
heat. It is no uncommon thing to see a bison bull<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
lay himself down in a puddle of water, and turn
himself round and round in it, till he has half
covered his body with mud. The puddle hole
which he thus makes is called a bison or buffalo
wallow. The puddle cools him while he is in
it, and when he quits it, the mud plastered on his
sides defends him from the burning heat of
the sun.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> What a figure a bison bull must cut,
with his shaggy hair and his sides plastered all
over with mud!</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Bears are often most formidable foes
to the hunter; but there is this striking difference
between the common bear and the grizzly bear,
that while the former eats mostly vegetables, and
will do his best to get out of your way, the latter
eats nothing but flesh, and is almost sure to attack
you. Hunters and Indians make it a rule never
to fire at a grizzly bear, unless in self-defence:
except in cases when they have a strong party,
or can fire from a tree; for, when he is wounded,
his fury knows no bounds.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> How can you escape from a grizzly
bear, if he is so very terrible?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The common bear can climb a tree,
as I have already told you; but the grizzly bear
is no climber. If you have time to get up into a
tree, you are safe: if not, you must reserve your
shot till the animal is near you, that you may take
a steady aim. You must then fight it out in the
best way you can. Grizzly bears are sometimes
of a very large size, measuring from nine to ten
feet in length. It was on the Upper Missouri that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
I was once chased by one of these terrible fellows,
and a narrow escape I had.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> How was it? Tell us all about it.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> I had just fired off my rifle at a bird
which I took for an eagle, little thinking how
soon my wasted bullet (for I did not strike the
bird) would be wanted in defence of my life. The
crack of my piece reverberated from the green-topped
bluffs that rose from the prairie; and I
suppose it was this that brought Sir Bruin upon
me. He came on with huge strides, and I had
nothing but a hunting-knife to use in my defence,
my discharged rifle being of no use. There was
no tree near, so throwing down my piece, I drew
my knife as a forlorn hope in my extremity.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> A hunting-knife against a grizzly bear!</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> When the huge monster was within
a few yards of me, to my amazement, I heard the
report of two rifles, and in the same instant my
tremendous foe fell, with two bullets in his head.
This timely assistance was rendered me by two of
our party, who, having followed my track, were
near me when I thought myself alone.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Never was any one in greater danger.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> I will tell you an anecdote that I have
read of a common bear. A boy, about eight
years old, was sent by his mother into the woods,
to bring home the old cow. At the distance of
somewhat more than half a mile, he found her,
attended by some young cattle. He began to drive
them home; but had not proceeded far, when a
bear came out of the bushes, and seemed disposed
to make his acquaintance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>The boy did not like his company; so he jumped
upon the old cow&#8217;s back, and held on by her
horns. She set out at full speed, and the bear
after her. The young cattle, lifting their tails in
the air, brought up the rear. Thus they proceeded,
the young ones behind frequently coming up
to the bear, and giving him a thrust with their
horns.</p>

<p>This compelled him to turn round, and thus the
old cow, with her brave rider, got somewhat in
advance. The bear then galloped on, and, approaching
the boy, attempted to seize him; but
the old cow cantered along, and finally brought
the boy to his mother&#8217;s house in safety. The
bear, thinking he should not be welcome there,
after approaching the house, turned about and
scampered back to the forest. Sir Bruin knew
when he was well off; a whole skin is the best
covering a bear can have; but, if he ventures
among mankind, he is likely enough to have it
stripped over his ears.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> That was a capital old cow, for she
saved the boy&#8217;s life.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> But the young cattle helped her, for
they pushed the bear with their horns.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> Please to tell us about wild horses.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The hordes or bands of wild horses
that abound in some of the prairies, are supposed
to be the offspring of Spanish horses, brought to
Mexico by Europeans. They are extremely shy,
keen in their sight and swift of foot, so that to
come up with them, except by surprise, is no easy
thing. I have seen them in great numbers from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the brow of a bluff, or have peeped at them cautiously
from a ravine.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> What kind of horses are they; and
of what colour?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Some of them are fine animals, but
in general they are otherwise. Stunted and coarse
in appearance, they are of various colours&mdash;bay,
chestnut, cream, gray, piebald, white and black,
with long tails, fetlocks, top-knots and manes.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> How do they catch them?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> In different ways. Sometimes a well-mounted
Indian, armed with his rifle, follows a
horde of horses, until he can get a fair shot at the
best among them. He aims at the top of the neck,
and if he succeeds in striking the high gristle
there, it stuns the animal for the moment, when
he falls to the ground without being injured. This
is called <i>creasing</i> a horse: but a bad marksman
would kill, and not crease, the noble animal he
seeks to subdue.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> What other way is there of catching
wild horses? for that seems to be a very bad one.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> It is a very bad way. They ought not
to shoot them.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> They are much more commonly taken
with the <i>lasso</i>; which is a thong at least a dozen
yards long, ending in a noose. This the Indians
throw, at full gallop, over the head of the flying
steed they wish to secure. Rarely do they miss
their aim. When a horse is thus caught, the
hunter leaps from his steed, and lets out the lasso
gradually, choking his captive till he is obliged
to stop: he then contrives to hopple or tie his fore-legs;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
to fasten the lasso round his lower jaw; to
breathe in his nostrils, and to lead him home.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Breathe in his nostrils! Why, what
does he do that for?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Because experience has taught him,
that it does much towards rendering his captive
more manageable. It is said, that if an Indian
breathes freely into the nostrils of a wild young
buffalo on the prairie, the creature will follow him
with all the gentleness and docility of a lamb.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> Well! that does appear strange!</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> There is one animal, which the Indians,
the hunters and trappers sometimes meet
with, that I have not mentioned. It is the cougar,
or panther, or American lion; for it goes by all
these names. Now and then it is to be seen in
the thick forests of the west; but, being a sad
coward, it is not so much dreaded as it otherwise
would be.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> I should not much like to meet a cougar.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The common wolf of America is as big
as a Newfoundland dog, and a sulky, savage-looking
animal he is. So long as he can feed in
solitary places he prefers to do so, but, when
hunger-pressed, he attacks the fold; after which,
Mr. Grizzly-skin loses no time in getting to a
place of shelter, for he knows that should he
outrun the stanch hounds that will soon be on
his track, yet will a rifle ball outrun him.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> Yes, yes; Mr. Grizzly-back is very
cunning.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The prairie-wolf is smaller than the
common wolf. Prairie-wolves hunt after deer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
which they generally overtake; or keep close to
a buffalo herd, feeding on such as die, or on those
that are badly wounded in fighting with one
another. The white, black, and clouded wolves
are in the northern parts. There are many kinds
of deer. I told you, that sometimes a deer-hunt
took place on a large scale, by enclosing a circle,
and driving the deer into it. In shooting antelopes,
the hunter has only to stick up his ramrod
in the ground in their neighbourhood, and throw
over it his handkerchief; while he, with his rifle
ready loaded, lies on the grass near at hand. The
antelopes will soon approach the handkerchief to
see what it is, when the hunter may make them
an easy prey. The largest deer is the moose deer,
which is often seven feet high. He is an awkward,
overgrown-looking creature, with broad
horns; but, awkward as he is, I question if any
of you could outrun him. Mountain and valley,
lake and river, seem alike to him, for he crosses
them all. In the snow, to be sure, the unwearied
and persevering hound will overtake him; but
let him beware of his horns, or he will be flying
head over heels in the air in a twinkling. The
moose deer, however, cannot successfully strive
with the hunter&#8217;s rifle.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Nothing can stand against man.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> And yet what is man opposed to his
Maker? His strength is perfect weakness! In a
moment, in a twinkling of an eye, he &#8220;changes
his countenance, and sends him away.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> What other kinds of deer do Indians
catch?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<img src="images/illo147.jpg" width="300" height="380" alt="The Wapiti Deer." title="" />
<span class="caption">The Wapiti Deer.</span>
</div>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The elk, with his large branching
horns, who would despise a palace as a dwelling-place.
Nothing less than the broad sky above
his head, and the ground of the boundless forest
beneath his feet, will satisfy him. After the elk,
come the Virginia, or common deer, the wapiti
deer, the black-tailed deer, and the cariboo. All
these are the prey of the hunter. Their savoury
flesh supplies him with food, and their soft skins
are articles of merchandise. The mountain sheep
may often be seen skipping from one ledge to
another of the rugged rocks, and precipitous clayey<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
cliffs of the western wilds, giving life to the solitary
place, and interest to the picturesque beauty of
lonely spots.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> You have mentioned all the animals
now, I think, that the hunter chases; for you
spoke before about beavers, badgers, foxes, raccoons,
squirrels and some others.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> You have never told us, though, how
they catch the musk-rat. I should like to know
that.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Well, then, I will tell you how they take
the musk-rat, but must first speak about the prairie
dog. Prairie dogs are a sort of marmot, but their
bark is somewhat like that of a small dog. Rising
from the level prairie, you may sometimes see, for
miles together, small hillocks of a conical form,
thrown up by the prairie dogs, which burrow
some eight or ten feet in the ground. On a fine
day, myriads of these dogs, not much unlike so
many rats, run about, or sit barking on the tops
of their hillocks. The moment any one approaches
them, they disappear, taking shelter in their burrows.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> Oh, the cunning little rogues.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The musk-rat builds his burrow (which
looks like a hay-stack) of wild rice stalks; so
that, while he has a dry lodging, a hole at the
bottom enables him, when he pleases, to pass into
the shallow water beneath his burrow or lodge.
In taking a musk-rat, a person strikes the top of
the burrow, and out scampers the tenant within;
but no sooner does he run through his hole into
the shallow water, than he is instantly caught<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
with a spear. Myriads of these little animals are
taken in this manner for their fur.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> They must be a good deal like prairie
dogs, though one has his house on the land, and
the other in the water.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> These wide prairies, on which roam
bisons and horses and deer innumerable; and
these shallow waters, where musk-rats abound,
will probably, in succeeding years, assume another
character. White men will possess them; civilized
manners and customs will prevail, and
Christianity spread from the Mississippi to the
Rocky Mountains; for the kingdoms of the world,
you know, are to become the kingdoms of our
Lord and of his Christ.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> You have told us a great deal indeed,
to-day, about the prairies.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> I have already spoken of the prairie
fires; I mean the burning grass set on fire by
accident, or purposely, for the double advantage
of obtaining a clearer path and an abundant crop of
fresh grass; but I must relate an adventure of my
own, of a kind not likely to be forgotten. So long
as a prairie fire is confined to the high grounds,
there is very little danger from it; for, in such
situations, the grass being short, the fire never
becomes large, though the line of flame is a long
one. Birds and beasts retire before it in a very
leisurely manner; but in plains where the grass
is long, it is very different.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> I should like to see one of those great,
high, round bluffs on fire. There must be a fine
bonfire then.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> There you are mistaken, for as I have
already told you, the grass is short on the bluffs.
To be sure, the sight of a bluff on fire, on a dark
night, is very singular; for as you can only see
the curved line of flame, the bluff being hidden
by the darkness, so it seems as though the curved
lines of flame were up in the air, or in the sky.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> They must look very beautifully.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> They do: but when a fire takes place
in a low bottom of long grass, sedge and tangled
dry plants, more than six feet high; and when a
rushing wind urges on the fiery ruin, flashing
like the lightning and roaring like the thunder;
the appearance is not beautiful, but terrible. I
have heard the shrill war-whoop, and the clash
of contending tomahawks in the fight, when no
quarter has been given. I have witnessed the
wild burst where Niagara, a river of waters, flings
itself headlong down the Horseshoe Fall; and I
have been exposed to the fury of the hurricane.
But none of these are half so terrible as the flaming
ocean of a long-grass prairie-fire.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Oh! it must be terrible.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The trapper is bold, or he is not fit for
his calling; the hunter is brave, or he could never
wage war as he does with danger; and the Indian
from his childhood is familiar with peril: yet
the Indian, the hunter and the trapper tremble,
as well they may, at a prairie-meadow fire. But
I must relate my adventure.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> I am almost afraid to hear it.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Poh! nonsense! It will never hurt
you.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> A party of five of us, well mounted,
and having with us our rifles and lances, were
making the best of our way across one of the low
prairie bottoms, where the thick coarse grass and
shrubs, even as we sat on our horses, were often
as high as our heads; when we noticed, every
now and then, a flight of prairie hens, or grouse,
rapidly winging their way by us. Two of our
party were of the Blackfoot tribe; their names
were Ponokah (elk) and Moeese (wigwam.)
These Indians had struck into a buffalo trail, and
we had proceeded for a couple of hours as fast as
the matted grass and wild pea-vines would allow,
when suddenly the wind that was blowing furiously
from the east became northerly, and in a moment,
Moeese, snuffing the air, uttered the words, &#8220;Pah
kapa,&#8221; (bad;) and Ponokah, glancing his eyes
northward, added, &#8220;Eehcooa pah kaps,&#8221; (very
bad.)</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> I guess what was the matter.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> And so do I.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> In another instant a rush was heard,
and Ponokah, who was a little ahead, cried out,
&#8220;Eneuh!&#8221; (buffalo!) when three bisons came
dashing furiously along another trail towards us.
No sooner did they set eyes on us, than they
abruptly turned southward. By this time, we all
understood that, to the north, the prairie was on
fire; for the air smelt strong. Deer, and bisons,
and other animals, sprang forward in different
directions from the prairie, and a smoke, not very
distant, like a cloud, was visible.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> I hope you set off at full gallop.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> We were quite disposed to urge our
horses onward; but the trail took a turn towards
the burning prairie, and we were obliged to force
our way into another, in doing which my horse
got his feet entangled, and he fell, pitching me
over his head some yards before him. I was not
hurt by the fall, for the thick herbage protected
me; but the worst of it was, that my rifle, which
had been carelessly slung, fell from my shoulder
among the long grass, and being somewhat confused
by my fall, I could not find it.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> You ought not to have stopped a
moment.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Perhaps not; but, to a hunter, a rifle
is no trifling loss, and I could not make up my
mind to lose mine. Time was precious, for the
smoke rapidly increased; and both Ponokah and
Moeese, who knew more about burning prairies
than I did, and were therefore more alive to our
danger, became very impatient. By the time my
rifle was found, and we were ready to proceed,
the fire had gained upon us in a crescent form, so
that before and behind we were hemmed in.
The only point clear of the smoke was to the
south; but no trail ran that way, and we feared
that, in forcing a road, another accident might
occur like that which had befallen us.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> I cannot think what you could do in
such a situation.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Our disaster had come upon us so
unexpectedly, and the high wind had so hurried
on the flaming storm, that there seemed to be no
time for a moment&#8217;s thought. Driven by necessity,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
we plunged into the thick grass to the south;
but our progress was not equal to that of the fire,
which was now fast approaching, blackening the
air with smoke, and roaring every moment louder
and louder. Our destruction seemed almost certain;
when Ponokah, judging, I suppose, by the
comparative thinness of the smoke eastward, that
we were not far from the boundary of the prairie
bottom, dashed boldly along a trail in that direction,
in the face of the fire, crying out to us to
follow. With the daring of men in extremity,
we put our horses to their speed, broke through
the smoke, fire, grass, and flame, and found ourselves
almost instantly on a patch of ground over
which the fire had passed; but, as the grass had
evidently been scanty, we were free from danger.
From a neighbouring bluff, which the smoke had
before hidden from our view, we saw the progress
of the flame&mdash;a spectacle that filled me with
amazement. The danger we had escaped seemed
increased by the sight of the fearful conflagration,
and I know not whether terror, amazement, or
thankfulness most occupied my mind.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> That was, indeed, a narrow escape.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> As we stood on the bluff, dismounted,
to gaze on the flying flames&mdash;which appeared in
the distance like a huge fiery snake of some miles
in length, writhing in torture&mdash;my wonder increased.
The spectacle was fearful and sublime,
and the conflagration nearest to us resembled the
breakers of the deep that dash on a rocky shore,
only formed of fire, roaring and destroying, preceded
by thick clouds of smoke. Before then, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
had been accustomed to sights and scenes of peril,
and had witnessed the burning of short grass to
some extent; but this was the first time I had
been in such fearful danger&mdash;the first time I felt
the awfulness of such a situation&mdash;the first time
that I had really seen the prairie on fire!</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> There can be nothing in the world like
a burning prairie, unless it be a burning mountain.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> A burning prairie, when we are near
it, is a vast and overwhelming spectacle; but
every rising and setting sun exhibits Almighty
wisdom, power and goodness, on a scale infinitely
beyond that of a hundred burning prairies. It
is a good thing to accustom ourselves to regard
the works of creation around us with that attention
and wonder they are calculated to inspire,
and especially to ponder on the manifestation of
God&#8217;s grace set forth in his holy word. When
burning prairies and burning mountains shall be
all extinguished; when rising and setting suns
and all earthly glory shall be unknown; then shall
the followers of the Redeemer gaze on the brighter
glories of heaven, and dwell for ever with their
Leader and their Lord.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buffaloes</span>, bears, wild horses, wolves, deer,
prairie-dogs and musk-rats, were a fruitful source
of conversation to the young people in their leisure
hours, until such time as they could again visit
their interesting friend at the cottage. Various
plans were formed to attack grizzly bears, to catch
wild horses, and to scare away half-famished
wolves; in all of which, Jowler, notwithstanding
his bad behaviour at the buffalo hunt, was expected
to act a distinguished part. Black Tom
was scarcely considered worth thinking about, he
being too wild by half for a wild horse, and too
faint-hearted for a grizzly bear. At one time, it
was so far determined for him to play the part of
a prairie-dog, that Austin set about digging a hole<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
for him: before it was finished, however, the plan
was abandoned; Brian and Basil both feeling positive
that, let Austin dig a hole as deep as he
would, Black Tom would never be persuaded to
run into it.</p>

<p>After much deliberation, catching wild horses
being given up&mdash;on the score that Black Tom
would run away too fast, and Jowler would not
run a way at all&mdash;a bear hunt was resolved on,
having, as Brian observed, two especial advantages:
the first, that all of them could enjoy the
sport at once; and the second, that Jowler would
be sure to attack them all, just like a grizzly bear.</p>

<p>No time was lost in preparing their long spears,
and in dressing themselves as much like renowned
chiefs as their knowledge and resources would allow.
And, in order that Jowler might the more
closely resemble a grizzly bear, a white apron was
spread over his broad back, and tied round his
neck. The lawn was, as before, the scene of their
exploits, the prairie on which the fearful monster
was to be overcome; and, to the credit of their
courage be it spoken, neither Austin, Brian nor
Basil, manifested the slightest token of fear.</p>

<p>Jowler was led by them among the bushes of the
shrubbery, that he might burst out upon them all
at once; and this part of the arrangement answered
excellently well, only that Jowler arrived on
the prairie first instead of last; add to which, the
bushes having so far despoiled him of his grizzly
hide, the white apron, as to have pulled it off his
back, he set to work mouthing and tearing at it,
to get it from his neck. At last, in spite of a few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
untoward and unbearlike actions on the part of
Jowler, the attack took place. With undaunted
resolution, Austin sustained Jowler&#8217;s most furious
charges; Brian scarcely manifested less bravery;
and little Basil, though he had broken his lance,
and twice fallen to the earth, made a desperate and
successful attack on his fearful antagonist, and
caught him fast by the tail. It was on the whole
a capital adventure; for though they could not
with truth say that they had killed the bear, neither
could the bear say that he had killed them.</p>

<p>The bear hunt being at an end, they set off for
the cottage; for the hunter had promised to describe
to them some of the games of the Indian
tribes, and he was soon engaged in giving them an
account of the ball-play of the Choctaws. &#8220;At
the Choctaw ball-play thousands of spectators attend,
and sometimes a thousand young men are
engaged in the game.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> It is played in the open prairie, and
the players have no clothes on but their trowsers,
a beautiful belt formed of beads, a mane of dyed
horse-hair of different colours, and a tail sticking
out from behind like the tail of a horse; this last
is either formed of white horse-hair or of quills.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> And how do they play?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Every man has two sticks, with a
kind of hoop at the end, webbed across, and
with these they catch and strike the ball. The
goal on each side, consisting of two upright posts
and a pole across the top, is set up twenty-five
feet high; these goals are from forty to fifty rods
apart. Every time either party can strike the ball<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
through their goal, one is reckoned, and a hundred
is the game.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> What a scuffle there must be among so
many of them!</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> When every thing is ready for the
game to begin, a gun is fired; and some old men,
who are to be the judges, fling up the ball in the
middle, half-way between the two goals.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> Now for the struggle.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> One party being painted white, every
man knows his opponent. No sooner is the ball
in the air, than a rush takes place. Every one
with his webbed stick raised above his head; no
one is allowed to strike or to touch the ball with his
hands. They cry out aloud at the very top of
their voices, rush on, leap up to strike the ball,
and do all they can to help their own side and
hinder their opponents. They leap over each
other, dart between their rivals&#8217; legs, trip them up,
throw them down, grapple with two or three at a
time, and often fall to fisticuffs in right earnest.
There they are, in the midst of clouds of dust,
running, striking and struggling with all their
might; so that, what with the rattle of the sticks,
the cries, the wrestling, the bloody noses, the
bruised shins, the dust, uproar and confusion, such
a scene of excitement is hardly to be equalled by
any other game in the world.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> How long does the game last?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> It begins about eight or nine o&#8217;clock
in the morning, and sometimes is scarcely finished
by sunset. A minute&#8217;s rest is allowed every time
the ball is urged beyond the goal, and then the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
game goes on again till it is finished. There is
another ball-play somewhat resembling this, which
is played by the women of the Prairie du Chien,
while the men watch the progress of the game, or
lounge on the ground, laughing at them.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Do they ever run races?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Yes, and very expert they are. Many
of the tribes are extravagantly fond of horses.
You see an Indian, with his shield and quiver, his
ornamented shirt, leggins, and mocassins; his long
hair flowing behind him, or his head-dress of the
war-eagle tailing gracefully nearly to his heels; his
lance in his hand; and his dress ornamented with
ermine, shells, porcupine quills and a profusion
of scalp-locks; but you see him out of character.
He should spring on a horse wild as the winds;
and then, as he brandished his lance, with his
pendent plumes, and hair and scalp-locks waving
in the breeze, you see him in his proper element.
Horse-racing among the Indians is an exciting
scene. The cruel custom, of urging useful and
noble animals beyond their strength, is much the
same in savage as in civilized life; but the scene
is oftentimes more wild, strange, and picturesque
than you can imagine.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Ay, I remember that the Camanchees
are capital riders. I was a Camanchee in our
buffalo hunt. Brian, you have not forgotten that?</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> But you had no horse to ride. I was
a Sioux; and the Sioux are capital riders too.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> And so are the Pawnees, I was a
Pawnee in the buffalo hunt.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> It was told me that the Camanchees&mdash;and,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
indeed, some of the Pawnees also&mdash;were
able, while riding a horse at full gallop, to lie
along on one side of him, with an arm in a sling
from the horse&#8217;s neck, and one heel over the
horse&#8217;s back; and that, while the body was thus
screened from an enemy, they could use their
lances with effect, and throw their arrows with
deadly aim. The Camanchees are so much on
their horses, that they never seem at their ease
except when they are flying across the prairie on
horseback.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> It would be worth going to the prairies,
if it were only to see the Camanchees ride.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Besides horse-races, the Indians have
foot-races and canoe-races and wrestling. The Indians
are also very fond of archery, in which, using
their bows and also arrows so much as they do, it
is no wonder they are very skilful. The game
of the arrow is a very favourite amusement with
them. It is played on the open prairie. There
is no target set up to shoot at, as there is generally;
but every archer sends his first arrow as
high as he can into the air.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Ay, I see! He who shoots the highest
in the air is the winner.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Not exactly so. It is not he who
shoots highest that is the victor; but he who can
get the greatest number of arrows into the air at
the same time. Picture to yourselves a hundred
well-made, active young men, on the open prairie,
each carrying a bow, with eight or ten arrows, in
his left hand. He sends an arrow into the air
with all his strength, and then, instantly, with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
rapidity that is truly surprising, shoots arrow
after arrow upwards, so that, before the first arrow
has reached the ground, half a dozen others have
mounted into the air. Often have I seen seven or
eight shafts from the same bow in the air at once.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Brian, we will try what we can do to-morrow;
but we shall never have so many as
seven or eight up at once.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The Indians are famous swimmers,
and, indeed, if they were not, it would often go
hard with them. They are taught when very
young to make their way through the water, and
though they do it usually in a manner different
from that of white men, I hardly think many white
men would equal them, either as to their speed,
or the length of time they will continue in the
water.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> But how do they swim, if their way is
different from ours? I can swim a little, and I
should like to learn their way, if it is the best.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> I am not quite prepared to say that;
for, though red men are more expert swimmers
than white men, that may be owing to their being
more frequently in the water. They fish a great
deal in the lakes; and they have often to cross
brooks and rivers in too much haste to allow them
to get into a canoe. A squaw thinks but very
little of plunging into a rolling river with a child
on her back; for the women swim nearly or
quite as well as the men.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> But you did not tell us wherein their
way of swimming is different from ours.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Whites swim by striking out their legs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
and both arms at the same time, keeping their
breasts straight against the water; but the Indian
strikes out with one arm only, turning himself on
his side every stroke, first on one side and then
on the other, so that, instead of his broad chest
breasting the water in front, he cuts through it
sideways, finding less resistance in that way than
the other. Much may be said in favour of both
these modes. The Indian mode requires more
activity and skill, while the other depends more
on the strength of the arms, a point in which
they far surpass the Indian, who has had little
exercise of the arms, and consequently but comparatively
little strength in those limbs. I always
considered myself to be a good swimmer, but I
was no match for the Indians. I shall not soon
forget a prank that was once played me on the
Knife River, by some of the Minatarees; it convinced
me of their adroitness in the water.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> What was it? Did they dip your head
under the water?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> No; you shall hear. I was crossing
the river in a bull-boat, which is nothing more
than a tub, made of buffalo&#8217;s skin, stretched on a
framework of willow boughs. The tub was just
large enough to hold me and the few things which
I had with me; when suddenly a group of young
swimmers, most of them mere children, surrounded
me, and began playfully to turn my tub
round and round in the stream. Not being prepared
to swim, on account of my dress, I began
to manifest some fear lest my poor tub should be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
overturned; but the more fearful I was, the better
pleased were my mirthful tormentors.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Ah! I can see it spinning round like
a peg-top, in the middle of the river.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> And did they upset the tub?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> No. After amusing themselves for
some time at my expense, now and then diving
under the tub, and then pulling down the edge
of it level with the water, on receiving a few
beads, or other trifles which I happened to have
with me, they drew me and my bull-boat to the
shore in safety. They were beautiful swimmers,
and, as I told you, I shall not soon forget
them.</p>

<p>The dances among the Indians are very numerous;
some of them are lively enough, while
others are very grave; and, then, most of the
tribes are fond of relating adventures.</p>

<p>There are the buffalo dance, the bear dance,
the dog dance and the eagle dance. And then
there are the ball-play dance, the green corn dance,
the beggars&#8217; dance, the slave dance, the snow-shoe
dance, and the straw dance; and, besides
these, there are the discovery dance, the brave
dance, the war dance, the scalp dance, the pipe-of-peace
dance, and many others that I do not at
this moment remember.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> You must please to tell us about
them all.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> But not all at once, or else we shall
have too short an account. Suppose you tell us
of two or three of them now.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> To describe every dance at length<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
would be tiresome, as many of them have the
same character. It will be better to confine ourselves
to a few of the principal dances. I have
known a buffalo dance continue for a fortnight or
longer, day and night, without intermission.
When I was among the Mandans, every Indian
had a buffalo mask ready to put on whenever he
required it. It was composed of the skin of a
buffalo&#8217;s head, with the horns on it; a long, thin
strip of the buffalo&#8217;s hide, with the tail at the
end of it, hanging down from the back of the
mask.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> What figures they would look with
their masks on! Did you say that they kept up
the dance day and night?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Yes. The Mandans were strong in
their village, but comparatively weak whenever
they left it, for then they were soon in the neighbourhood
of their powerful enemies. This being
the case, when the buffaloes of the prairie wandered
far away from them, they were at times
half starved. The buffalo dance was to make
buffaloes come back again to the prairies near
them.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> But how could they bring them back
again?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The buffalo dance was a kind of
homage paid to the Great Spirit, that he might
take pity on them, and send them supplies.
The dancers assembled in the middle of the village,
each wearing his mask, with its horns and
long tail, and carrying in his hand a lance, or a
bow and arrows. The dance began, by about a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
dozen of them thus attired, starting, hopping,
jumping and creeping in all manner of strange,
uncouth forms; singing, yelping, and making odd
sounds of every description, while others were
shaking rattles and beating drums with all their
might; the drums, the rattles, the yelling, the
frightful din, with the uncouth antics of the dancers,
altogether presented such a scene, that, were
you once to be present at a buffalo dance,
you would talk of it long after, and would not
forget it all the days of your lives.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> And do they keep that up for a fortnight?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Sometimes much longer, for they
never give over dancing till the buffaloes come.
Every dancer, when he is tired, (and this he
makes known by crouching down quite low,) is
shot with blunt arrows, and dragged away, when
his place is supplied by another. While the
dance is going on, scouts are sent out to look for
buffaloes, and as soon as they are found, a shout
of thanksgiving is raised to the Great Spirit, to
the medicine man, and to the dancers, and preparation
is made for a buffalo hunt. After this, a
great feast takes place; all their sufferings from
scarcity are forgotten, and they are as prodigal,
and indeed wasteful, of their buffalo meat, as if
they had never known the want of it.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Well, I should like to see the buffalo
dance. Could not we manage one on the lawn,
Brian?</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> But where are we to get the buffalo
masks from? The buffalo hunt did very well,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
but I hardly think we could manage the dance
Please to tell us of the bear dance.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> I think it will be better to tell you
about that, and other dances, the next time you
visit me; for I want to read to you a short
account, which I have here, of a poor Indian
woman of the Dog-ribbed tribe. I have not said
much of Indian women, and I want you to feel
kindly towards them. It was Hearne, who went
with a party from Hudson&#8217;s Bay to the Northern
Ocean, many years ago, who fell in with the poor
woman.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> Oh, yes; let us hear all about her; and
you can tell us of the dances when we come again.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Now, then, I will begin. One day
in January, when they were hunting, they saw the
track of a strange snow-shoe, which they followed,
and at a considerable distance came to a little hut,
where they discovered a young woman sitting
alone. On examination, she proved to be one
of the Dog-ribbed Indians, who had been taken
prisoner by another tribe, in the summer of 1770;
and, in the following summer, when the Indians
that took her prisoner were near this place, she
had escaped from them, intending to return to her
own country. But the distance being so great,
and having, after she was taken prisoner, been
carried in a canoe the whole way, the turnings
and windings of the rivers and lakes were so
numerous that she forgot the track; so she built
the hut in which she was found, to protect her
from the weather during the winter, and here she
had resided from the first setting-in of the fall.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> What, all by herself! How lonely
she must have been!</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> From her account of the moons
passed since her escape, it appeared that she had
been nearly seven months without seeing a human
face; during all which time she had supplied
herself very well, by snaring partridges, rabbits
and squirrels: she had also killed two or three
beavers, and some porcupines. She did not seem
to have been in want, and had a small stock of
provisions by her when she was discovered.
She was in good health and condition, and one
of the finest of Indian women.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> I should have been afraid that other
Indians would have come and killed her.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The methods practised by this poor
creature to procure a livelihood were truly admirable,
and furnish proof that necessity is indeed
the mother of invention. When the few deer
sinews, that she had an opportunity of taking with
her, were expended, in making snares and sewing
her clothing, she had nothing to supply their place
but the sinews of the rabbits&#8217; legs and feet.
These she twisted together for that purpose with
great dexterity and success. The animals which
she caught in those snares, not only furnished her
with a comfortable subsistence, but of the skins
she made a suit of neat and warm clothing for
the winter. It is scarcely possible to conceive
that a person in her forlorn situation could be so
composed as to be capable of contriving and
executing any thing that was not absolutely necessary
to her existence; but there was sufficient<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
proof that she had extended her care much farther,
as all her clothing, besides being calculated
for real service, showed great taste, and exhibited
no little variety of ornament. The materials,
though rude, were very curiously wrought, and
so judiciously placed, as to make the whole of
her garb have a very pleasant, though rather romantic
appearance.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> Poor woman! I should like to have
seen her in the hut of her own building, and the
clothes of her own making.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Her leisure hours from hunting had
been employed in twisting the inner rind or bark
of willows into small lines, like net-twine, of
which she had some hundred fathoms by her.
With these she intended to make a fishing-net, as
soon as the spring advanced. It is of the inner
bark of the willows, twisted in this manner, that
the Dog-ribbed Indians make their fishing-nets;
and they are much preferable to those made by
the Northern Indians.</p>

<p>Five or six inches of an iron hoop, made into
a knife, and the shank of an arrow-head of iron,
which served her as an awl, were all the metals
this poor woman had with her when she escaped;
and with these implements she had made herself
complete snow-shoes, and several other useful
articles.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Capital! Why, she seems able to do
every thing.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Her method of making a fire was
equally singular and curious, having no other
materials for that purpose than two hard stones.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
These, by long friction and hard knocking, produced
a few sparks, which at length communicated
to some touch-wood. But as this method was
attended with great trouble, and not always successful,
she did not suffer her fire to go out all the
winter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Never</span>, sure, did young people make a more
grotesque appearance, than did Austin, Brian, and
Basil Edwards, in their attempt to get up a buffalo
dance. Each had a mat over his shoulders, and
a brown paper mask over his face; two wooden
pegs on a string made a very respectable pair of
horns; bows and arrows were in abundance; a
toy rattle and drum, with the addition of an iron
spoon and a wooden trencher, supplied them with
music; and neither Mandan, Pawnee, Crow,
Sioux, Blackfoot, nor Camanchee, could have
reasonably complained of the want of either noise
or confusion.</p>

<p>Then, again, they were very successful in bringing
buffaloes, without which the dance, excellent
as it was, would have been but an unsatisfactory<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
affair. Black Tom had been prudently shut up
in the tool-house, and Jowler tied up to a tree
hard by, so that, when it became expedient for
buffaloes to appear, the house of Black Tom was
opened, and Jowler was set at liberty. All things
considered, the affair went off remarkably well.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are come to hear of the bear dance, and
the dog dance, and the beggars&#8217; dance, and the
green corn dance,&#8221; said Austin to the hunter, on
the following day, when a visit was paid to the
cottage. The hunter, with his accustomed kindness
to the young people, lost no time in entering
on his narrative. &#8220;You must not forget,&#8221; said
he, &#8220;that many of the dances of the Indians partake
of a religious character, for in them reverence
and adoration are freely offered. The Indians&#8217;
worship of the Great Spirit, as I have already told
you, is mingled with much of ignorance and superstition,
whether in dances or in other observances;
yet do they, at times, leave upon the mind
of a spectator a deep impression of their sincerity,
though this does not excuse their error. I have
not as yet described their music, and therefore will
do it now.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Yes. Now for the music of the Indians,
if you please, sir.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> If you ever go among them, and mingle
in their dances, you must not expect to have a
band of music such as you have in our cities.
Whistles, flutes, rattles and drums are almost all
their musical instruments. You would be surprised
at the music that some of the young Indians
produce with the mystery whistle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Why is it called the mystery whistle?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> I have already told you that the red
man calls every thing mystery, or medicine, that
is surprising; and as the notes of this whistle are
particularly sweet, it may be called a mystery
whistle on this account. There is another whistle
that is very much in request among the Indians,
and that is the war whistle. The onset and the
retreat in battle are sounded on this instrument by
the leading chief, who never goes on an expedition
without it. It is made of bone, and sometimes
it is formed of the leg bone of a large bird.
The shrill, scream-like note, which is the signal
for rushing on an enemy, would make you start.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> What sort of a drum do they use? Is
it a kettle-drum?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> No. It is merely a piece of raw hide,
stretched as tight as it can be pulled over a hoop.
Some of their drums have but one end, or surface,
to beat upon, while others have two. What they
would do in their dances without their drums I
do not know, for you hear them continually.
Their rattles are of different kinds, some much
larger than others; but the principle on which
they are formed is the same, that is, of enclosing
stones of different sizes in hard, dry, raw hide.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Have they no trumpets and cymbals,
and clarionets and violins?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> No, nothing of the kind. They have
a deer-skin flute, on which very tolerable music
is sometimes made; but, after all, it must be admitted
that Indians are much better buffalo hunters
than musicians.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Ay; they are quite at home in hunting
buffaloes.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Yes; and they are at home, too, in
dancing, being extremely nimble of foot. Some
of their dances are so hideous that you would be
disgusted with them, while others would keep you
laughing in spite of yourselves.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> You must please to tell us about these
dances.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Dancing is a very favourite amusement
of the Indians; though it is, for the most
part, of a character so different from that of dancing
in civilized life, that few people, ignorant of its
meaning and allusions, would like it. The body
is so continually in a stooping attitude, and the
gestures and grimaces appear to be so unmeaning,
that at first it leaves an impression that they are
ridiculing the art of dancing, rather than entering
into it in right earnest. There is such creeping
and jumping and starting, that a spectator can
make but little of it.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> I can fancy that I see a party joining
in the buffalo dance now, with their masks over
their faces. Please to tell us of the bear dance.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> By and by. I will describe a few
other dances first. The beggars&#8217; dance is undertaken
to prevail on such of the spectators as
abound in comforts to give alms to those who are
more scantily provided with them. It is danced
by the young men who stand high in the tribe.
These shake their rattles, hold up their pipes and
brandish their lances, while they dance; chanting
in an odd strain, at the top of their voices, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
praise of the Great Spirit, and imploring him to
dispose the lookers on to give freely. The dancers
are all naked, with the exception of a sort of kilt
formed of quills and feathers; and a medicine
man keeps on all the time beating furiously on
a drum with a rattle, and hallooing out as loud
as he can raise his voice.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> That ought to be called the begging
dance, and not the beggars&#8217; dance; for the dancers
do not beg for themselves, but for others.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> You see that the object of the dance is
a good one; for many a skin, or pouch, or pipe,
or other necessary article, is given by the spectators
to those of their tribe who need them. It is
not common among the Indians for their aged
men and mystery men to mingle in the dance, and
yet I have seen, on especial occasions, a score of
them jumping and capering in a way very creditable
to their agility. The Sioux have a dance
that ought to be called the doctors&#8217; dance, or the
dance of the chiefs.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> Why, do the doctors dance in it?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Yes; while a medicine man beats his
drum, and a party of young women sing, the
chiefs of the tribe and the doctors make their
appearance, splendidly attired in their costliest
head-dresses, carrying a spear in one hand and a
rattle in the other. Every movement is strictly
regulated by the beat of the drum, and the dance
by degrees becomes more and more spirited, until
you would suppose the party must be exhausted:
but men so much in the open air, and whose limbs
are so little restrained by bandages and tight clothing,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
can bear a great deal of fatigue. The pipe
dance is one of the most animated amusements.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> Oh! do tell us about the pipe dance.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> In the ground in the centre of the village
a fire is lighted, and a party assemble round
it; every one smoking his pipe, as he sits on his
buffalo skin, as though nothing was farther from
his thoughts than dancing. While these are
whiffing away at a distance from the fire, a mystery
man, who sits nearer to the flame, smokes a
longer pipe, grunting at the same time a kind of
tune. Suddenly is heard the rub-a-dub of a drum,
or the beat of some other instrument of the same
kind; when instantly starts to his feet one of the
smokers, hopping like a parched pea, spinning
round like a top, and starting and jumping, at
every beat of the drum, in a very violent manner.
In this way he goes round the smokers, seemingly
threatening them all, and at last pounces upon
one of them, whom he compels to dance in the
same manner as himself. The new dancer acts
his part like the former one, capering and jumping
round the smokers, and compelling another
to join them. Thus the dance continues, till all of
them are occupied, when the hopping, the jumping,
the frightful postures into which they throw themselves,
together with the grunting, growling,
singing, hooting and hallooing, are beyond all
belief. There are few dances of the Indians
more full of wild gestures and unrestrained turbulence
than the pipe dance.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> I hope you have a good many more
dances to tell us of.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The green corn dance of the Minatarees
must be described to you. Among Indian tribes,
green corn is a great luxury, and the time when
it ripens is a time of rejoicing. Dances and songs
of thanksgiving are abundant; and the people
give way not only to feasting, but also to gluttony;
so that often, by abusing the abundance in their
possession, they bring upon themselves the miseries
of want. The Indians have very little fore-thought.
To enjoy the present, and to trust the
future to the Great Spirit, is their constant practice.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> How long does the green corn dance
last?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> For eight or ten days, during which
time there is the most unbounded prodigality.
Among many of the tribes, the black drink, a
very powerful medicine, is taken two or three
days before the feast, that the green corn may be
eaten with a sharp appetite and an empty stomach.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> In what way does the green corn dance
begin?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> As soon as the corn is in a proper
state&mdash;and this is decided by the mystery men&mdash;runners
are despatched through the village, that
all may assemble on the following day to the dance
and the feast. Sufficient corn for the required
purpose is gathered by the women, who have the
fields under their care, and a fire is made, over
which a kettle, with green corn in it, is kept
boiling; while medicine men, whose bodies are
strangely painted, or bedaubed with clay of a
white colour, dance round it in very uncouth
attitudes, with corn-stalks in their hands.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> I dare say, while the pot is boiling,
they are all longing to begin the feast.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The first kettle-full is not for themselves,
it is an offering to the Great Spirit. There
are many customs among the Indians which cannot
but bring the Jews to our remembrance; and
this offering of the first green corn does so very
forcibly. The medicine men round the fire shake
their rattles, hold up their corn-stalks, and sing
loudly a song of thanksgiving, till the corn is sufficiently
boiled; it is then put upon the fire and
consumed to a cinder. Before this offering is
made, none of the Indians would dare to taste of
the luxurious fare; but, afterwards, their appetite
is unrestrained.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Then they begin to boil more corn, I
suppose.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> A fresh fire is made, a fresh kettle of
corn is prepared, and the dance goes on; the
medicine men keeping close to the fire, and the
others capering and shouting in a larger circle,
their energy increasing as the feast approaches
nearer and nearer. The chiefs and medicine men
then sit down to the feast, followed by the whole
tribe, keeping up their festivity day after day, till
the corn-field has little more grain remaining in it
than what is necessary for seed. You have heard
the saying, &#8220;Wilful waste brings woful want.&#8221;
The truth of this saying is often set forth, as well
in civilized life as among the Indians.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> I wonder what dance will come next.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> I need not describe many others. If
I run rapidly through two or three, and dwell a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
little on the bear dance and the war dance, you
will then have heard quite enough about dances.
The scalp dance is in use among the Sioux or
Dahcotas. It is rather a fearful exhibition; for
women, in the centre of a circle, hold up and
wave about the scalps which have been torn from
the slaughtered foes of the tribe, while the warriors
draw around them in the most furious attitudes,
brandishing their war-clubs, uttering the
most hideous howls and screams. The Indians
have many good qualities, but cruelty seems to
mingle with their very nature. Every thing is
done among them that can be done, to keep alive
the desire to shed blood. The noblest act a red
man can perform, and that which he thinks the
most useful to his tribe and the most acceptable
to the Great Spirit, is to destroy an enemy, and to
bear away his scalp as a trophy of his valour. If
it were only for this one trait in the Indian character,
even this would be sufficient to convince
every humane person, and especially every Christian,
of the duty and great advantage of spreading
among them the merciful principles of Christianity.
A holy influence is necessary to teach the
untutored red man to forgive his enemies, to subdue
his anger, to abate his pride, and to stay his
hand in shedding human blood. The new commandment
must be put in his heart: &#8220;That ye
love one another.&#8221; The Mandan boys used to
join in a sham scalp dance, in which they conducted
themselves just like warriors returning from
a victorious enterprise against their enemies.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> They are all sadly fond of fighting.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> In the brave dance, of the Ojibbeways,
there is plenty of swaggering: the dancers seem
as if they knew not how to be proud enough of
their warlike exploits. The eagle dance, among
the Choctaws, is an elegant amusement; and the
snow-shoe dance, of the Ojibbeways, is a very
amusing one.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> Please to tell us about them both.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> I must not stay to describe them particularly:
it will be enough to say, that, in the
one, the dancers are painted white, and that they
move about waving in their hands the tail of the
eagle; in the other&mdash;which is performed on the
first fall of snow, in honour of the Great Spirit&mdash;the
dancers wear snow-shoes, which, projecting
far before and behind their feet, give them in the
dance a most strange and laughable appearance.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> I should very much like to see that
dance; there is nothing cruel in it at all.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> And I should like to see the eagle dance,
for there is no cruelty in that either.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The straw dance is a Sioux dance of
a very curious description. Loose straws are tied
to the bodies of naked children; these straws are
then set on fire, and the children are required to
dance, without uttering any expression of pain.
This practice is intended to make them hardy,
that they may become the better warriors.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> That is one of the strangest dances of all.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> I will now say a little about the bear
dance, and the war dance. The bear dance is
performed by the Sioux before they set off on a
bear-hunt. If the bear dance were left unperformed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
they would hardly hope for success. The
Bear spirit, if this honour were not paid to him,
would be offended, and would give them no success
in the chase.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> What! do the Sioux think there is a
Bear spirit?</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illo180.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Bear Dance." title="" />
<span class="caption">Bear Dance.</span>
</div>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Yes. The number of spirits of one
kind or another, believed in by the Indians, is very
great. In the bear dance, the principal performer
has a bear-skin over him, the head of it hanging
over his head, and the paws over his hands.
Others have masks of bears&#8217; faces; and all of
them, throughout the dance, imitate the actions of
a bear. They stoop down, they dangle their
hands, and make frightful noises, beside singing
to the Bear spirit. If you can imagine twenty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
bears dancing to the music of the rattle, whistle,
and drum, making odd gambols, and yelling out
the most frightful noises, you will have some notion
of the bear dance.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> Now for the war dance: that is come
at last.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> It is hardly possible to conceive a
more exciting spectacle than that of the war dance
among the Sioux. It exhibits Indian manners
on the approach of war. As, among civilized
people, soldiers are raised either by recruiting or
other means; so, among the Indians, something
like recruiting prevails. The red pipe is sent
through the tribe, and every one who draws a
whiff up the stem thereby declares he is willing
to join the war party. The warriors then assemble
together, painted with vermilion and other colours,
and dressed in their war clothes, with their
weapons and their war-eagle head-dresses.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> What a sight that must be!</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> When the mystery man has stuck up
a red post in the ground, and begun to beat his
drum, the warriors advance, one after another,
brandishing their war-clubs, and striking the red
post a violent blow, while the mystery man sings
their death-song. When the warriors have struck
the post, they blacken their faces, and all set to dancing
around it. The shrill war-whoop is screamed
aloud, and frantic gestures and frightful yells show,
but too plainly, that there will be very little mercy
extended to the enemy that falls into their hands.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> That war dance would make me
tremble.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The Mandan boys used to assemble at
the back of their village, every morning, as soon
as the sun was in the skies, to practise sham
fighting. Under the guidance and direction of
their ablest and most courageous braves and warriors,
they were instructed in all the mysteries of
war. The preparations, the ambush, the surprise,
the combat and the retreat, were made familiar
to them. Thus were they bred up from their
youth to delight in warfare, and to long for opportunities
of using their tomahawks and scalping-knives
against their foes.</p>

<p>When you next come to see me, I will give
you an account of the cruel customs of the mystery
lodge of the Mandans; with the hope that it will
increase your abhorrence of cruelty and bloodshed,
render you more than ever thankful for the
blessings of peace, and more anxious to extend
them all over the earth. The hardest of all lessons
now, to a red man, is, as I have before intimated,
to forgive his enemies; but when, through
Divine mercy, his knowledge is extended, and
his heart opened to receive the truths of the gospel,
he will be enabled to understand, to love, and to
practise the injunction of the Saviour, &#8220;Love
your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good
to them that hate you, and pray for them which
despitefully use you, and persecute you.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was well for Austin Edwards and his brothers,
that their acquaintance with their friend the
hunter commenced during one of their holidays,
so that they were enabled to pay him a visit more
frequently than they otherwise could have done.
The life led by the hunter would have been far
too solitary for most people; but his long wanderings
in the extended prairies, and his long
sojournings in places remote from society, had
rendered the quiet tranquillity of country scenes
pleasant to him: yet, still, as variety has its
charms, it afforded him a pleasant change, whenever
the three brothers visited him.</p>

<p>In his younger days, he had entered on the life
of a hunter and trapper with much ardour. To<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
pursue the buffalo (or, more properly speaking,
the bison) of the prairie, the deer, and other
animals, and to mingle with the different tribes of
Indians, was his delight. With wild animals and
wild men he became familiar, and even the very
dangers that beset his path gave an interest to his
pursuits: but his youth was gone, his manhood
was declining, and the world that he once looked
upon as an abiding dwelling-place, he now regarded
as the pathway to a better home.</p>

<p>Time was, when to urge the arrow or the spear
into the heart of the flying prey for mere diversion,
and to join in the wild war-whoop of contending
tribes, was congenial to his spirit; but his mind
had been sobered, so that now to practise forbearance
and kindness was far more pleasant than
to indulge in cruelty and revenge. He looked on
mankind as one great family, which ought to
dwell in brotherly love; and he regarded the
animal creation as given by a heavenly Hand,
for the use, and not the abuse, of man.</p>

<p>In relating the scenes in which he had mingled
in earlier years, he was aware that he could not
avoid calling up, in some measure, in the youthful
hearts of his auditors, the natural desire to see
what was new and strange and wonderful, without
reflecting a moment on the good or the evil
of the thing set before them: but he endeavoured
to blend with his descriptions such remarks as
would lead them to love what was right and to
hate what was wrong. Regarding the Indian
tribes as an injured people, he sought to set before
his young friends the wrongs and oppressions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
practised on the red man; that they might sympathize
with his trials, and feel interested for his
welfare.</p>

<p>The few words that had dropped from his lips,
about the ordeal through which the Indians pass
before they are allowed to join war-parties, had
awakened Austin&#8217;s curiosity. Nor was it long
before, seated with his brothers in the cottage, he
was listening to the whole account. &#8220;Please to
begin at the very beginning,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and I
shall not lose a single word.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The Sioux, the Crows, the Sacs, the
Ojibbeways, the Camanchees, and the Chippewas,
all exhibit astonishing proofs of patience and
endurance under pain; but in none of the tribes
has ever such torture been inflicted, or such
courage witnessed, in enduring torment, as among
the Mandans.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> Now we shall hear.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The Mandans, who, as I have already
told you, lived, when I was a hunter, on the
Upper Missouri, held a mystery lodge every year;
and this was indeed a very solemn gathering of
the tribe. I was never present in the lodge on
this occasion, but will give you the description
of an eye-witness.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> Why did they get together? What did
they do?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> You shall hear. The mystery lodge,
or it may be called the religious meeting, was
held, first, to appease the wrath and secure the
protection of the good and the evil spirits; secondly,
to celebrate the great flood, which they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
believed took place a long time ago; thirdly, to
perform the buffalo dance, to bring buffaloes; and,
fourthly, to try the strength, courage and endurance
of their young men, that they might know
who were the most worthy among them, and the
most to be relied on in war-parties.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> How came the Mandans to know any
thing about the flood, if they have no Bibles?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> That I cannot tell. Certain it is, that
they had a large, high tub, called the Great Canoe,
in the centre of their village, set up in commemoration
of the flood; and that they held the
mystery lodge when the willow leaves were in
their prime under the river bank, because, they
said, a bird had brought a willow bough in full
leaf to the Great Canoe in the flood.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Why, it is just as if they had read the
Bible.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The fact of the deluge (however they
came by it) had undoubtedly been handed down
among them by tradition for many generations:
but I must go on with my account of the Mandan
gathering. The mystery lodge was opened by a
strange-looking man, whom no one seemed to
know, and who came from the prairie. This odd
man called for some edge-tool at every wigwam
in the village; and all these tools, at the end of
the ceremonies, were cast into the river from a
high bank; as an offering, I suppose, to the Water
spirit. After opening the mystery lodge, and appointing
a medicine man to preside, he once more
disappeared on the prairie.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> What an odd thing!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Twenty or thirty young men were
in the lodge, candidates for reputation among the
tribe, who had presented themselves to undergo
the prescribed tortures. As they reclined in the
lodge, every one had hung up over his head, his
shield, his bow and quiver, and his medicine bag.
The young men were painted different colours.
The old mystery man appointed to superintend
the ceremonies sat by a fire in the middle of the
lodge, smoking leisurely with his medicine pipe,
in honour of the Great Spirit; and there he sat
for four days, and as many nights, during which
the young men neither tasted food nor drink, nor
were they allowed to close their eyes.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> It was enough to kill them all.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> On the floor of the lodge were buffalo
and human skulls, and sacks filled with water,
shaped like tortoises, with sticks by them. During
each of the four days, the buffalo dance was
performed over and over again, by Indians, painted,
and wearing over them whole buffalo skins, with
tails and hoofs and horns; while in their hands
they carried rattles, and long, thin, white wands,
and bore on their backs bundles of green boughs
of the willow. Some of the dancers were painted
red, to represent the day; and others black, with
stars, to resemble the night. During these dances,
which took place round the Great Canoe, the tops
of the wigwams were crowded with people.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> I want to hear about the young Indians
in the lodge, and that old fellow, the
mystery man.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The superstitious and cruel practices<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
of the mystery lodge are too fearful to dwell upon.
I shall only just glance at them, that you
may know, in some degree, the kind of trials the
young Indians have to endure. While the dances
were going on, mystery men, inside the lodge,
were beating on the water sacks with sticks, and
animating the young men to act courageously,
telling them that the Great Spirit was sure to support
them. Splints, or wooden skewers, were
then run through the flesh on the back and breasts
of the young warriors, and they were hoisted up,
with cords fastened to the splints, towards the top
of the lodge. Not a muscle of their features expressed
fear or pain.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> Shocking! shocking!</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> That must be horrible!</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> After this, other splints were run
through their arms, thighs and legs; and on
these were hung their shields, arms and medicine
bags. In this situation they were taunted, and
turned round with poles till they fainted; and
when, on being let down again, they recovered,
those who had superior hardihood would crawl
to the buffalo skull in the centre of the lodge, and
lay upon it the little finger of their left hand to
be chopped off; and even the loss of a second or
third finger is counted evidence of superior boldness
and devotion. After this, they were hurried
along between strong and fleet runners: this was
called &#8220;the last race,&#8221; round and round the Great
Canoe, till the weight of their arms having pulled
the splints from their bodies, they once more
fainted, and in this state, apparently dead, they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
were left to themselves, to live or die, as the
Great Spirit might determine.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> I should think that hardly any of them
would ever come to life again.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Nor would they, under common circumstances;
but, when we consider that these
young men had fasted for four days, and lost much
blood in their tortures, there was not much danger
of inflammation from their wounds, and their
naturally strong constitutions enabled them to recover.
All these tortures were willingly undertaken;
nor would any one of those who endured
them, on any account whatever, have evaded
them. To propitiate the Great Spirit, and to
stand well in the estimation of his own tribe, are
the two highest objects in the mind of an Indian.</p>

<hr />

<p>The day after that on which Austin and his
brothers heard from the hunter the account of the
mystery lodge, and the sufferings of the young
Mandans before they were thought equal to engage
in a war-party, two or three little accidents occurred.
In the first place, Austin, in making a
new bow, cut a deep gash in his finger: and, in
the next, Brian and Basil, in scrambling among
the hedges in quest of straight twigs for arrows,
met with their mishaps; for Brian got a thorn in
his thumb, while Basil had a roll down the bank
into a dry ditch.</p>

<p>It is always a good sign in young people, when
they put into practice any real or supposed good
quality of which they hear or read. The patience<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
and endurance of the young Mandans had called
forth high commendations from Austin, and it was
evident, in the affair of the cut finger, that he
made a struggle, and a successful one too, in controlling
his feelings. With an air of resolution,
he wrapped the end of his pocket handkerchief
tightly round the wound, and passed off the occurrence
as a matter of no moment. Not a word
escaped little Basil when he rolled into the ditch;
nor did Brian utter a single &#8220;oh!&#8221; when the
thorn was extracted from his thumb.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illo190.jpg" width="400" height="297" alt="A War-Party." title="" />
<span class="caption">A War-Party.</span>
</div>

<p>&#8220;You may depend upon it,&#8221; said Austin, after
some conversation with Brian and Basil, on the
subject of the young Mandans, &#8220;that the next
time we see the hunter, we shall hear something
about the way in which red men go to war. The
sham fight, and the preparation of the young warriors,
will be followed by some account of their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
battles.&#8221; In this supposition he was quite correct;
for, when they next visited the cottage, the
hunter proposed to speak a little about councils
and encampments and alarms and surprises and
attacks. The conversation was carried on in the
following manner.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> How do the Indians poison their arrows?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> By dipping the point of the arrow-head
into the poison prepared. The head of the
arrow, as I told you, is put on very slightly, so
that it remains in the wound when the arrow is
withdrawn.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> Where do they get their poison? What
is it made of?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> No doubt there is some difference in
the manner of preparing poison among the different
tribes. But, usually, it is, I believe, composed
of deadly vegetable substances, slowly
boiled together, sometimes mingled with the mortal
poison of snakes and ants. This is prepared
with great care. Its strength is usually tried on
a lizard, or some other cold-blooded, slow-dying
animal. It is rapid in its effects; for, if a fowl
be wounded with a poisoned weapon, it dies in a
few minutes; a cat dies in five minutes; a bison,
in five or six; and a horse, in ten. Jaguars and
deer live but a short time after they are thus
wounded. If, then, horses and bisons are so soon
destroyed by the poison, no wonder that men
should be unable to endure its fatal effects.</p>

<p>Before war is determined on among the Indians,
a council is held with great solemnity. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
chiefs, and braves, and medicine men are assembled.
Then the enlisting takes place, which I
have already described; the war dance is engaged
in, and weapons are examined and repaired. The
chief, arrayed in full dress, leads on his band.
They march with silence and rapidity, and encamp
with great caution, appointing sentinels in every
necessary direction. Thus, lurking, skulking
and marching, they reach the place of their destination.
Another war council is held, to decide
on the mode of attack; and then, with rifles, war-clubs,
scalping-knives and bows and poisoned
arrows, they fall upon their unsuspecting foes.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> It is very sad to fight with such weapons
as poisoned arrows.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> It is sad to fight with any kind of
weapons; but, when once anger enters the heart,
and the desire to shed blood is called forth, no
mode is thought too cruel that will assist in obtaining
a victory. The continual warfare that is
carried on between Indian tribes must be afflictive
to every humane and Christian spirit. None
but the God of peace can destroy the love of war
in the hearts of either red or white men.</p>

<p>Indians fight in a way very different from civilized
people; for they depend more on cunning,
stratagem and surprise, than on skill and courage.
Almost all their attacks are made under cover of
night, or when least expected. A war-party will
frequently go a great distance, to fall upon a village
or an encampment on a quarter most accessible.
To effect their object, they will hide for
any length of time in the forest, sleep in the long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
grass, lurk in the ravine, and skulk at nightfall
around the place to be attacked.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Did you ever go out with the Indians
to fight?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Yes. For some time I was treated
very hospitably among the Crows, near the Rocky
Mountains; and as they had determined to go on
one of their war-parties, which I could not prevent,
I resolved to go along with them, to watch
their way of proceeding.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Do tell us all about it.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> It was a thoughtless and foolish affair,
when I was young and rash; but I wished to be
a spectator of all their customs. It was, as I said,
one of those foolish undertakings into which the
ardour of my disposition led me, and for which I
was very near paying the price of my life. A
council was held, wherein it was decided to send
a strong war-party on foot to surprise a Blackfoot
village. Every stratagem had been used to lull
the enemy into security.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> Ay; that is just like the Indians.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The red pipe was sent through the
tribe, for the warriors to smoke with it, much after
the manner of the Sioux; the red post was struck,
and the braves and attendants painted their faces.
When the plan of attack was agreed on, every
warrior looked to his weapons; neither bow nor
arrow, war-club nor scalping-knife, was left unexamined.
There was an earnestness in their preparation,
as though they were all animated with
one spirit.</p>

<p>It was some time after sundown, that we left<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
the village at a quick pace. Runners were sent
out in all directions, to give notice of an enemy.
We hastened along a deep valley, rounded the
base of a bluff, and entered the skirt of a forest,
following each other in files beneath the shadowy
branches. We then passed through some deep
grass, and stole silently along several defiles and
ravines. The nearer we drew to the Blackfoot
village, the more silently and stealthily we proceeded.
Like the panther, creeping with noiseless
feet on his prey, we stole along the intricate
pathways of the prairie bottoms, the forest, the
skirt of the river and the hills and bluffs. At last
we made a halt, just as the moon emerged from
behind a cloud.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Then there was terrible work, I dare say.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> It was past midnight, and the Blackfoot
village was wrapped in slumber. The Crow
warriors dispersed themselves to attack the village
at the same instant from different quarters. The
leader had on his full dress, his medicine bag, and
his head-dress of war-eagle plumes. All was
hushed in silence, nearly equal to that of the
grave; when suddenly the shrill war-whistle of
the Crow chief rung through the Blackfoot lodges,
and the wild war-whoop burst at once from a
hundred throats. The chief was in the thickest
of the fight. There was no pity for youth or age;
the war-club spared not, and the tomahawk was
merciless. Yelling like fiends, the Crow warriors
fled from hut to hut, from victim to victim.
Neither women nor children were spared.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> Dreadful! dreadful!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Though taken thus by surprise, the
Blackfoot braves, in a little time, began to collect
together, clutching their weapons firmly, and rushing
on their enemies, determined to avenge their
slaughtered friends. The panic into which they
had been thrown subsided, and, like men accustomed
to danger, they stood not only in self-defence,
but attacked their foes with fury.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> I wonder that every one in the Blackfoot
village was not killed!</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> In civilized life, this would very likely
have been the case; but in a savage state, men
from their childhood are trained up to peril. They
may lie down to slumber on their couches of skins,
but their weapons are near at hand; and though
it be the midnight hour when an attack is made
on them, and though, awakened by the confusion,
they hear nothing but the war-cry of their enemy,
they spring to their feet, seize their arms, and rush
on to meet their foes. It was thus with the Blackfoot
braves. Hand to hand, and foot to foot, they
met their assailants; brave was opposed to brave;
and the horrid clash of the war-club and the murderous
death-grapple succeeded each other. Even
if I could describe the horrors of such a scene, it
would not be right to do so. As I was gazing on
the conflict, I suddenly received a blow that struck
me bleeding to the ground. You may see the scar
on my temple still. The confusion was at its
height, or else my scalp would have been taken.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> How did you get away?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Stunned as I was, I recovered my
senses before a retreat took place, and was just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
able to effect my escape. The Crows slaughtered
many of their enemies; but the Blackfoot warriors
and braves were at last too strong for them.
Then was heard the shrill whistle that sounded a
retreat. With a dozen scalps in their possession,
the Crows sought the shelter of the forest, and
afterwards regained their own village.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Are the Crow tribe or the Blackfoot
tribe the strongest?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The Crow Indians, as I told you, are
taller and more elegant men than the Blackfeet;
but the latter have broader chests and shoulders.
The Blackfeet, some think, take their name from
the circumstance of their wearing black, or very
dark brown leggings and mocassins. Whether,
as a people, the Crows or the Blackfeet are the
strongest, there is a diversity of opinion. The
Blackfeet are almost always at war with the
Crows.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> What battling there must be among
them!</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Their war-parties are very numerous,
and their encampments are very large: and, whether
seen in the day, in the midst of their lodges;
or at night, wrapped in their robes, with their
arms in their hands, ready to leap up if attacked
by an enemy; they form a striking spectacle.
Sometimes, in a night encampment, a false alarm
takes place. A prowling bear, or a stray horse,
is taken for a foe; and sometimes a real alarm is
occasioned by spies crawling on their hands and
knees up to their very encampment to ascertain
their strength. On these occasions the shrill<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
whistle is heard, every man springs up armed and
rushes forth, ready to resist his assailing enemy.
I have seen war-parties among the Crows and
Blackfeet, the Mandans and Sioux, the Shawanees,
Poncas, Pawnees and Seminoles. But a
Camanchee war-party, mounted on wild horses,
with their shields, bows and lances, which I once
witnessed, was the most imposing spectacle of
the kind I ever saw. The chief was mounted on
a beautiful war-horse, wild as the winds, and yet
he appeared to manage him with ease. He was
in full dress, and seemed to have as much fire in
his disposition as the chafed animal on which he
rode. In his bridle-hand, he clutched his bow
and several arrows; with his other hand, he
wielded his long lance; while his quiver and
shield were slung at his back, and his rifle across
his thigh.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> I think I can see him. But what
colour was his war-horse?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Black as a raven; but the white foam
lay in thick flakes on his neck and breast, for his
rider at every few paces stuck the sharp rowels
of his Spanish spurs into his sides. He had a
long flowing mane and tail, and his full and fiery
eyes seemed ready to start out of his head. The
whole Camanchee band was ready to rush into
any danger. At one time, they were flying over
the prairie in single file; and at another, drawn
up all abreast of each other. The Camanchees
and the Osages used to have cruel battles one with
another. The Mandans and the Riccarees, too,
were relentless enemies.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> And the Sacs and Foxes were great
fighters, for Black Hawk was a famous fellow.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Yes, he was. But I have never told
you, I believe, how the medicine man, or mystery
man, conducts himself when called unto a wounded
warrior.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Not a word of it. Please to tell us
every particular.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> In some cases cures are certainly performed;
in others, the wounded get well of themselves:
but, in most instances, the mystery man
is a mere juggler.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> Now we shall hear of the mystery
man.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The Crow war-party that I had joined
brought away two of their wounded warriors when
they retreated from the Blackfoot village, but
there seemed to be no hope of saving their lives.
However, a mystery man was called on to use
his skill.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Ay; I want to know how the mystery
man cures his patients.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> If ever you should require a doctor, I
hope you will have one more skilful than the
mystery man that I am going to describe. The
wounded warriors were in extremity, and I thought
that one of them was dying before the mystery
man made his appearance; but you shall hear.
The wounded men lay groaning on the ground,
with Indians around them, who kept moaning even
louder than they did; when, all at once, a scuffle
of feet and a noise like that of a low rattle were
heard.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> The mystery man was coming, I suppose.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> He was; and a death-like silence was
instantly preserved by all the attendant Indians.
In came the mystery man, covered over with the
shaggy hide of a yellow bear, so that, had it not
been that his mocassins, leggings and hands
were visible, you might have supposed a real
bear was walking upright, with a spear in one
paw, and a rattle, formed like a tambourine, in the
other.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> He could never cure the dying man with
his tambourine.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> From the yellow bear-skin hung a profusion
of smaller skins, such as those of different
kinds of snakes, toads, frogs and bats; with hoofs
of animals, beaks and tails of birds, and scraps and
fragments of other things; a complete bundle of
odds and ends. The medicine man came into the
circle, bending his knees, crouching, sliding one
foot after the other along the ground, and now and
then leaping and grunting. You could not see
his face, for the yellow bear-head skin covered it,
and the paws dangled before him. He shuffled
round and round the wounded men, shaking his
rattle and making all kinds of odd noises; he
then stopped to turn them over.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> He had need of all his medicine.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Hardly had he been present a minute,
before one of the men died; and, in ten minutes
more, his companion breathed his last. The medicine
man turned them over, shook his rattle over
them, howled, groaned and grunted; but it would
not do; the men were dead, and all his mummery<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
would not bring them back to life again; so, after
a few antics of various kinds, he shuffled off with
himself, shaking his rattle, and howling and groaning
louder than ever. You may remember, that I
told you of the death of Oseola, the Seminole
chief: he who struck his dagger through the
treaty that was to sign away the hunting-grounds
of his tribe, in exchange for distant lands.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Yes. You said that he dashed his dagger
not only through the contract, but also through
the table on which it lay.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> And you told us that he was taken
prisoner by treachery and died in captivity.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Now I will tell you the particulars of
his death; for I only said before, that he died
pillowed on the faithful bosom of his wife. He
had his two wives with him when he died, but
one was his favourite.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Please to let us know every thing about
him. It was at Fort Moultrie in Charleston, South
Carolina.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Finding himself at the point of death,
he made signs that the chiefs and officers might
be assembled, and his wishes were immediately
complied with. The next thing he desired was,
that his war-dress, that dress in which he had so
often led his tribe to victory, might be brought to
him. His wife waited obediently upon him, and
his war-dress was placed before him.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> What could he want of his war-dress
when he was going to die?</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Wait a little, Basil, and you will hear
all about it, I dare say.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> It was an affecting sight, to see him
get up from his bed on the floor, once more to
dress himself as a chief of his tribe, just as if he
was about to head an expedition against the
whites. Well, he put on his rich mocassins, his
leggings adorned with scalp-locks, his shirt and
his ornamental belt of war. Nor did he forget
the pouch that carried his bullets, the horn that
held his powder; nor the knife with which he had
taken so many scalps.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> How very strange for a dying man to
dress himself in that way!</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> In all this, he was as calm and as
steady as though about to hunt in the woods with
his tribe. He then made signs, while sitting up
in his bed, that his red paint should be given him,
and his looking-glass held up, that he might paint
his face.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> And did he paint his face himself?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Only one half of it; after which his
throat, neck, wrists and the backs of his hands
were made as red as vermilion would make them.
The very handle of his knife was coloured over in
the same way.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> What did he paint his hands and his
knife-handle for?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Because it was the custom of his tribe,
and of his fathers before him, to paint themselves
and their weapons red, whenever they took an
oath of destruction to their enemies. Oseola did
it, no doubt, that he might die like a chief of his
tribe; that he might show those around him, that,
even in death, he did not forget that he was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
Seminole warrior. In that awful hour, he put on
his splendid turban with its three ostrich feathers,
and then, being wearied with the effort he had
made, he lay down to recover his strength.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> How weak he must have been!</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> In a short time he rose again, sitting
in his full dress like the leader of a warlike tribe,
and calmly and smilingly extended his hand to
the chiefs and officers, to his wives and his children.
But this, his last effort, exhausted his remaining
strength. He was lowered down on the
bed, calmly drew his scalping-knife from its
sheath under his war-belt, where it had been
placed, and grasped it with firmness and dignity.
With his hands crossed on his manly breast, and
with a smile on his face, he breathed his last.
Thus passed away the spirit of Oseola.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Poor Oseola! He died like a chief,
at last.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> He did, but not like a Christian, and,
very likely, when he grasped his scalping-knife,
before his last breath forsook him, some glowing
vision of successful combat was before him. In
the pride of his heart, perhaps, he was leading on
his braves to mingle in the clash of battle and
the death-grapple with his enemies. But is this
a fit state of mind for a man to die in? Much as
we may admire the steady firmness and unsubdued
courage of an Indian warrior in death, emotions
of pride and high-mindedness, and thoughts
of bloodshed and victory, are as far removed as
possible from the principles of Christianity, and most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
unsuitable to a dying hour. Humility, forgiveness,
repentance, hope, faith, peace and joy, are needed
at such a season; and the time will come, we
trust, when Indians, taught better by the gospel,
will think and feel so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> holidays of the three brothers were drawing
to a close; and this circumstance rendered
them the more anxious to secure one or two more
visits to the cottage, before they settled down in
right earnest to their books. Brian and Basil
talked much about the poisoned arrows, and the
mystery man; but Austin&#8217;s mind was too much
occupied with the Camanchee chief on his black
war-horse, and the death of the Seminole chief
Oseola, to think much of any thing else. He
thought there was something very noble in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
valour of a chief leading on his tribe to conquest;
and something almost sublime in a warrior
dressing himself up in his war-robes to die. Like
many other young people of ardent dispositions,
he seemed to forget, that when a victory is enjoyed,
a defeat must be endured; and that before
any one can rejoice in taking a scalp, some
one must be rendered miserable or lifeless by
losing it. The remarks of the hunter, respecting
the inconsistency of such customs with the peaceful
principles of religion, especially the solemnities
of a dying hour, had not been made altogether in
vain; yet still he dwelt on the image of Oseola
grasping his scalping-knife, crossing his hands
over his breast, and dying with a smile on his
countenance.</p>

<p>On their next walk to the cottage, the way was beguiled
by endeavouring to call to mind all that had
been told them on their last visit; and, to do him
justice, he acquitted himself uncommonly well.
It is true, that now and then his brothers refreshed
his memory on some points which had escaped
him; but, on the whole, his account was full,
connected, and clear.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what must I tell you now?&#8221; said the
hunter, as soon as he and the young people had
exchanged salutations. &#8220;Do you not know
enough about the Indians?&#8221;</p>

<p>To this inquiry, Brian replied that what they
had heard had only increased their curiosity to
hear more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well; let me consider,&#8221; said the hunter. &#8220;I
have told you about the different tribes of Indians,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
their religion, languages, manners and customs;
their villages, wigwams, food, dress, arms and
musical instruments. I have described to you the
fur trade; and dwelt on the scenery of the
country, the mountains, rivers, lakes, prairies
and many remarkable places. I have related the
adventures of Black Hawk and Nikkanochee.
And, besides these things, you have had a tolerably
full account of buffaloes, bears, wild horses,
wolves, deer and other animals, with the manner
of hunting them; as well as a relation of Indian
amusements, dances, sham fights, war-parties, encampments,
alarms, attacks, scalping and retreats.
Let me now, then, dwell a little on the Indian
way of concluding a treaty of peace, and on a
few other matters; after which, I will conclude
with the best account I can give you of what the
missionaries have done among the different tribes.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> I shall be very sorry when you have
told us all.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> And so shall I: for it is so pleasing to
come here, and listen to what you tell us.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> When it is agreed between hostile
tribes that a treaty of peace shall be made, the
chiefs and medicine men of the adverse tribes
meet together, and the calumet, or peace-pipe,
ornamented with eagle quills, being produced,
every one smokes a few whiffs through it. It is
then understood by them that the tomahawk is to
be buried. The pipe-of-peace dance is then performed
by the warriors, to the beat of the Indian
drum and rattle, every warrior holding his pipe in
his hand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> That pipe-of-peace dance is a capital
dance, for then bloodshed is at an end.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Unfortunately, war is apt soon to
break out again, and then the buried tomahawk
becomes as busy as ever.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Well, I do like the Indians, in spite
of all their faults, and I think they have been used
cruelly by the whites.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> As a general remark, those Indians
who have had least to do with civilized life are
the most worthy of regard. Such as live near
white men, or such as are frequently visited by
them, seem to learn quickly the vices of others,
without giving up their own. To observe the
real character of red men, it is necessary to trace
the turnings and windings of the Yellow Stone
River, or the yet more remote sinuosities of the
Upper Missouri. The nearer the United States,
the more servile is the Indian character; and the
nearer the Rocky Mountains, the more independent
and open-hearted.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> If I ever go among the red men, the
Yellow Stone River, or the Upper Missouri, will
be the place for me.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Many of the chiefs of the tribes near
the Rocky Mountains may be said to live in a
state of splendour. They have the pure air of
heaven around them and rivers abounding in fish.
The prairie yields them buffaloes in plenty; and,
as for their lodges and dress, some of them may
be called sumptuous. Sometimes, twenty or
thirty buffalo skins, beautifully dressed, are joined
together to form a covering for a lodge; and their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
robes and different articles of apparel are so rich
with ermine, the nails and claws of birds and animals,
war-eagle plumes, and embroidery of highly
coloured porcupine quills, that a monarch in his
coronation robes is scarcely a spectacle more imposing.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Ay, I remember the dress of Mah-to-toh-pa,
&#8220;the four bears,&#8221; his buffalo robe, his porcupine-quilled
leggings, his embroidered buckskin
mocassins, his otter necklace, his buffalo
horns, and his splendid head-dress of war-eagle
plumes.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> In a state of war, it is the delight of a
chief to leap on the back of his fiery steed, decorated
as the leader of his tribe, and armed with
his glittering lance and unerring bow, to lead on
his band to victory. In the chase, he is as ardent
as in the battle; smiling at danger, he plunges,
on his flying steed, among a thousand buffaloes,
launching his fatal shafts with deadly effect. Thus
has the Indian of the far-west lived, and thus is
he living still. But the trader and the rum-bottle,
and the rifle and the white man are on his track;
and, like his red brethren who once dwelt east
of the Mississippi, he must fall back yet farther,
and gradually decline before the approach of
civilization.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> It is a very strange thing that white
men will not let red men alone. What right
have they to cheat them of their hunting-grounds?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> I will relate to you an account, that
appeared some time ago in most of the newspapers
(though I cannot vouch for the truth of it,) of
a chief who, though he was respected by his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
tribe before he went among the whites, had very
little respect paid to him afterwards.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> I hope it is a long account.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Not very long: but you shall hear.
&#8220;In order to assist the officers of the Indian department,
in their arduous duty of persuading
remote tribes to quit their lands, it has been found
advisable to incur the expense of inviting one or
two of their chiefs some two or three thousand
miles to Washington, in order that they should
see with their own eyes, and report to their tribes,
the irresistible power of the nation with which
they are arguing. This speculation has, it is said,
in all instances, more or less effected its object.
For the reasons and for the objects we have stated,
it was deemed advisable that a certain chief should
be invited from his remote country to Washington;
and accordingly, in due time, he appeared there.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Two or three thousand miles! What
a distance for him to go!</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> &#8220;After the troops had been made to
man&#339;uvre before him; after thundering volleys
of artillery had almost deafened him; and after
every department had displayed to him all that
was likely to add to the terror and astonishment
he had already experienced, the President, in lieu
of the Indian&#8217;s clothes, presented him with a
colonel&#8217;s uniform; in which, and with many other
presents, the bewildered chief took his departure.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> He would hardly know how to walk in
a colonel&#8217;s uniform.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> &#8220;In a pair of white kid gloves; tight
blue coat, with gilt buttons, gold epaulettes, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
red sash; cloth trowsers with straps; high-heeled
boots; cocked hat, and scarlet feather; with a
cigar in his mouth, a green umbrella in one hand,
and a yellow fan in the other; and with the neck
of a whiskey bottle protruding out of each of
the two tail-pockets of his regimental coat; this
&#8216;monkey that had seen the world&#8217; suddenly appeared
before the chiefs and warriors of his tribe;
and as he stood before them, straight as a ramrod,
in a high state of perspiration, caused by the
tightness of his finery, while the cool fresh air of
heaven blew over the naked, unrestrained limbs
of the spectators, it might, perhaps not unjustly,
be said of the costumes, &#8216;Which is the savage?&#8217;
In return for the presents he had received, and
with a desire to impart as much real information
as possible to his tribe, the poor jaded traveller
undertook to deliver to them a course of lectures,
in which he graphically described all that he had
witnessed.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> An Indian in white kid gloves, blue
coat, high-heeled boots, and cocked hat and feather!
Why his tribe would all laugh at him, in
spite of his lectures.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> &#8220;For a while he was listened to with
attention; but as soon as the minds of his audience
had received as much as they could hold,
they began to disbelieve him. Nothing daunted,
however, the traveller still proceeded.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> I thought they would laugh at him.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> &#8220;He told them about wigwams, in
which a thousand people could at one time pray
to the Great Spirit; of other wigwams, five stories<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
high, built in lines, facing each other, and extending
over an enormous space: he told them of
war canoes that would hold twelve hundred warriors.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> They would be sure never to believe
him.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> &#8220;Such tales, to the Indian mind,
seemed an insult to common sense. For some
time he was treated merely with ridicule and contempt;
but, when, resolutely continuing to recount
his adventures, he told them about a balloon, and
that he had seen white people, who, by attaching
a great ball to a canoe, as he described it, could
rise in it up to the clouds, and travel through the
heavens, the medicine, or mystery men of his tribe
pronounced him to be an impostor; and the
multitude vociferously declaring that he was too
great a liar to live, a young warrior, in a paroxysm
of anger, levelled a rifle and shot him dead!&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Well, I am very sorry! It was very
silly to be dressed up in that way; but they ought
not to have killed him, for he told them the truth,
after all.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> I could never have thought that an Indian
chief would have dressed himself in a blue
coat and gilt buttons.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> And, then, the fan and green umbrella!</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Ay, and the whiskey bottles sticking
out of his tail-pockets. He would look a little
different from Mah-to-toh-pa.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> I have frequently spoken of the splendid
head-dress of the chiefs of some tribes. Among
the Mandans, (and you know Mah-to-toh-pa was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
a Mandan,) they would not part with one of their
head-dresses of war-eagle plumes at a less price
than two horses. The Konzas, Osages, Pawnees,
Sacs, Foxes and Iowas shave their heads; but
all the rest, or at least as far as I know of the
Indian tribes, wear long hair.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> Yes; we remember the Crows, with
their hair sweeping the ground.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Did I tell you, that some of the tribes
glue other hair to their own to make it long, as it
is considered so ornamental?</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> I do not remember that you told us that.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> There are a few other things respecting
the Indians that I wish to mention, before I
tell you what the missionaries have done among
them. In civilized countries, people turn out
their toes in walking; but this is not the case
among the Indians. When the toes are turned
out, either in walking or running, the whole
weight of the body falls too much on the great
toe of the foot that is behind, and it is mainly
owing to this circumstance, that so many have a
deformity at the joint of the great toe. When the
foot is turned in, the weight of the body is thrown
equally on all the toes, and the deformity of the
great toe joint is avoided.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> What! do the Indians know better
how to walk than we do? If theirs is the best
way to walk, why do not we all walk so?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> I suppose, because it is not so elegant
in appearance to walk so. But many things are
done by civilized people on account of fashion.
Hundreds and hundreds of females shorten their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
lives by the tight clothing and lacings with which
they compress their bodies; but the Indians do
not commit such folly.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> There is something to be learned from
the Indians, after all.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> There is a custom among the Sacs
and Foxes that I do not think I spoke of. The
Sacs are better provided with horses than the
Foxes: and so, when the latter go to war and
want horses, they go to the Sacs and beg them.
After a time, they sit round in a circle, and take
up their pipes to smoke, seemingly quite at their
ease; and, while they are whiffing away, the
young men of the Sacs ride round and round the
circle, every now and then cutting at the shoulders
of the Foxes with their whips, making the
blood start forth. After keeping up this strange
custom for some time, the young Sacs dismount,
and present their horses to those they have been
flogging.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> What a curious custom! I should not
much like to be flogged in that manner.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> There is a certain rock which the
Camanchees always visit when they go to war.
Putting their horses at full speed, they shoot their
best arrows at this rock, which they consider
great medicine. If they did not go through this
long-established custom, there would be no confidence
among them; but, when they have thus
sacrificed their best arrows to the rock, their hope
and confidence are strong.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> I should have thought they would
have wanted their best arrows to fight with.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> There is no accounting for the superstitions
of people. There is nothing too absurd
to gain belief even among civilized nations, when
they give up the truth of God&#8217;s word, and follow
the traditions or commandments of men. The
Sioux have a strange notion about thunder; they
say that the thunder is hatched by a small bird,
not much bigger than the humming-bird. There
is, in the Couteau des Prairies, a place called
&#8220;the nest of the thunder;&#8221; and, in the small
bushes there, they will have it that this little bird
sits upon its eggs till the long claps of thunder
come forth. Strange as this tradition is, there
would be no use in denying it; for the superstition
of the Indian is too strong to be easily done
away with. The same people, before they go on
a buffalo hunt, usually pay a visit to a spot where
the form of a buffalo is cut out on a prairie.
This figure is great medicine; and the hunt is
sure to be more prosperous, in their opinion, after
it has been visited.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> I do hope that we shall forget none of
these curious things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> the last time but one, during their holidays,
Austin and his brothers set off, with a long
afternoon before them, to listen to the hunter&#8217;s
account of the proceedings of the missionaries
among the Indians. On this occasion, they paid
another visit to the Red Sand-stone Rock by the
river, the place where they first met with their
friend, the hunter. Here they recalled to mind
all the circumstances which had taken place at that
spot, and agreed that the hunter, in saving their
lives by his timely warning, and afterwards adding
so much as he had done to their information
and pleasure, had been to them one of the best
friends they had ever known. With very friendly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
and grateful feelings towards him, they hastened
to the cottage, when the Indians, as usual, became
the subject of their conversation. &#8220;And now,&#8221;
said Austin, &#8220;we are quite ready to hear about
the missionaries.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Let me speak a word or two about
the Indians, before I begin my account. You remember
that I told you of the Mandans.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Yes. Mah-to-toh-pa was a Mandan,
with his fine robes and war-eagle head-dress. The
rain-makers were Mandans; also the young warriors,
who went through so many tortures in the
mystery lodge.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Well, I must now tell you a sad truth.
After I left the Mandans, great changes came upon
them; and, at the present time, hardly a single
Mandan is alive.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Dreadful! But how was it? What
brought it all about?</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> You should have told us this before.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> No. I preferred to tell you first of
the people as they were when I was with them.
You may remember my observation, in one of
your early visits, that great changes had taken
place among them; that the tomahawks of the
stronger tribes had thinned the others; that many
had sold their lands to the whites, and retired to
the west of the Mississippi; and that thousands
had fallen a prey to the small-pox. It was in the
year 1838 that this dreadful disease was introduced
among the Mandans, and other tribes of the fur-traders.
Of the Blackfeet, Crows and two or
three other tribes, twenty-five thousand perished;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
but of the poor Mandans, the whole tribe was
destroyed.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> Why did they not get a doctor; or go
out of their village to the wide prairie, that one
might not catch the disease from another?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Doctors were too far off; and the
ravages of the disease were so swift that it swept
them all away in a few months. Their mystery
men could not help them; and their enemies, the
Sioux, had war-parties round their village, so that
they could not go out to the wide prairie. There
they were, dying fast in their village; and little
else was heard, during day or night, but wailing,
howling and crying to the Great Spirit to relieve
them.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> And did Mah-to-toh-pa, &#8220;the four
bears,&#8221; die too?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Yes. For, though he recovered from
the disease, he could not bear up against the loss
of his wives and his children. They all died before
his eyes, and he piled them together in his lodge,
and covered them with robes. His braves and
his warriors died, and life had no charms for him;
for who was to share with him his joy or his grief?
He retired from his wigwam, and fasted six days,
lamenting the destruction of his tribe. He then
crawled back to his own lodge, laid himself by
his dead family, covered himself with a robe, and
died like an Indian chief. This is a melancholy
picture; and when I first heard of the terrible
event, I could have wept.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> It was indeed a terrible affair. Have
they no good doctors among the Indians now?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Why do they not send for doctors who know how
to cure the small-pox, instead of those juggling
mystery men?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Many attempts have been made to
introduce vaccination among the tribes; but their
jealousy and want of confidence in white men,
who have so much wronged them, and their attachment
to their own customs and superstitions,
have prevented those attempts from being very successful.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Who was the first missionary who
went among the Indians?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> I believe the first Indian missionary
was John Eliot. More than two hundred years
ago, a body of pious Englishmen left their native
land, because they were not allowed peaceably to
serve God according to their consciences. They
landed in America, having obtained a grant of
land there. They are sometimes called &#8220;Puritans,&#8221;
and sometimes &#8220;the Pilgrim Fathers.&#8221; It
is certain, that, whatever were their peculiarities,
and by whatever names they were known, the fear
of God and the love of mankind animated their
hearts.</p>

<p>These men did not seize the possessions of the
Indians, because they had arms and skill to use
them. But they entered into a treaty with them
for the purchase of their lands, and paid them
what they were satisfied to receive. It is true,
that what the white man gave in exchange was
of little value to him. But the Indians prized
trinkets more than they would gold and silver,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
and they only wanted hunting and fishing grounds
for their own use. These early colonists, seeing
that the Indians were living in idleness, cruelty
and superstition, were desirous to instruct them in
useful arts, and still more in the fear of the Lord;
and John Eliot, who had left England to join his
religious friends in America, was the first Protestant
missionary among the Indians.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> I wonder he was not afraid of going
among them.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> He that truly fears God has no need
to fear danger in the path of duty. John Eliot
had three good motives that girded his loins and
strengthened his heart: the first, was the glory
of God, in the conversion of the poor Indians;
the second, was his love of mankind, and pity for
such as were ignorant of true religion; and the
third, was his desire that the promise of his friends
to spread the gospel among the Indians should be
fulfilled. It was no light task that he had undertaken,
as I will prove to you. I dare say, that
you have not quite forgotten all the long names
that I gave you.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> I remember your telling us of them;
and I suppose they are the longest words in the
world.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> I will now give you two words in one
of the languages that John Eliot had to learn, and
then, perhaps, you will alter your opinion. The
first of them is <i>noorromantammoonkanunonnash</i>,
which means, &#8220;our loves;&#8221; and the second, or
&#8220;our questions,&#8221; is <i>kummogokdonattoottammoctiteaongannunnonash</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Why that last word would reach all
across one of our copy-books.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> You had better learn those two words,
Austin, to begin with.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> Ay, do, Austin; if you have many such
when you go among the red men, you must sit
up at night to learn what you have to speak in
the day-time.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> No, no; I have settled all that. I
mean to have an interpreter with me; one who
knows every thing. Please to tell us a little more
about Eliot.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> I will. An author says, speaking of
missionaries, &#8220;As I hold the highest title on earth
to be that of a servant of God, and the most important
employment that of making known to
sinners the salvation that God has wrought for
them, through his Son Jesus Christ; so I cannot
but estimate very highly the character of an
humble, zealous, conscientious missionary. Men
undertake, endure and achieve much when
riches and honours and reputation are to be attained;
but where is the worldly reputation of
him who goes, with his life in his hand, to make
known to barbarous lands the glad tidings of salvation?
Where are the honours and the money
bags of the missionary? In many cases, toil and
anxiety, hunger and thirst, reviling and violence,
danger and death await him; but where is his
earthly reward?&#8221; Eliot&#8217;s labours were incessant;
translating not only the commandments, the Lord&#8217;s
prayer and many parts of Scripture into the Indian
languages, but also the whole Bible. For days<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
together he travelled from place to place, wet to
the skin, wringing the wet from his stockings at
night. Sometimes he was treated cruelly by the
sachems, (principal chiefs,) sagamores, (lesser
chiefs,) and powaws, (conjurers, or mystery men;)
but though they thrust him out, and threatened his
life, he held on his course, telling them that he
was in the service of the Great God, and feared
them not. So highly did they think of his services
in England, that a book was printed, called
&#8220;The Day-breaking, if not the Sun-rising of the
Gospel with the Indians in New-England;&#8221; and
another, entitled &#8220;The Clear Sunshine of the
Gospel breaking forth upon the Indians;&#8221; and
dedicated to the parliament; in order that assistance
and encouragement might be given him. At
the close of a grammar, published by him, he
wrote the words, &#8220;Prayers and pains, through
faith in Christ Jesus, will do any thing.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> I should think that he was one of the
best of men.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> He instituted schools, and devoted
himself to the Christian course he had undertaken
with an humble and ardent spirit, until old age
and increasing infirmities rendered him too feeble
to do as he had done before. Even then, he
catechised the negro slaves in the neighbourhood
around him; and took a poor blind boy home to
his own house, that he might teach him to commit
to memory some of the chapters in the Bible.
Among the last expressions that dropped from his
lips were the words, &#8220;Welcome joy! Pray!
pray! pray!&#8221; This was in the eighty-sixth year<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
of his age. No wonder he should even now be remembered
by us as &#8220;the apostle of the Indians.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> I am very glad that you told us about
him. What a good old man he must have been
when he died!</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> You will find an interesting history of
Eliot in your Sunday-school Library, and the Life
of Brainerd<a name="FNanchor_5_11" id="FNanchor_5_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_11" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> also, of whom I will tell you a few
things. But I advise you to read both books, for
such short remarks as I make cannot be distinctly
remembered; and the characters of these eminent
men you will only understand by reading the
history of their lives.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_11" id="Footnote_5_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_11"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> Both these works are published by the American Sunday-school
Union.</p></div>

<p><i>Austin.</i> We will remember this.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> There were many good men, after his
death, who trod as closely as they could in his
steps: but I must not stop to dwell upon them.
David Brainerd, however, must not be passed by:
he was a truly humble and zealous servant of the
Most High. You may judge, in some degree, of
his interest in the Indians by the following extract
from his diary:</p>

<p><i>June 26.</i> &#8220;In the morning, my desire seemed
to rise, and ascend up freely to God. Was busy
most of the day in translating prayers into the
language of the Delaware Indians; met with great
difficulty, because my interpreter was altogether
unacquainted with the business. But though I
was much discouraged with the extreme difficulty
of that work, yet God supported me; and, especially
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>in the evening, gave me sweet refreshment.
In prayer my soul was enlarged, and my faith
drawn into sensible exercise; was enabled to cry
to God for my poor Indians; and though the
work of their conversion appeared <i>impossible with
man</i>, yet <i>with God</i> I saw <i>all things were possible</i>.
My faith was much strengthened, by observing
the wonderful assistance God afforded his servants
Nehemiah and Ezra, in reforming his people and
re-establishing his ancient church. I was much
assisted in prayer for my dear Christian friends,
and for others whom I apprehended to be Christ-less;
but was more especially concerned for the
poor heathen, and those of my own charge; was
enabled to be instant in prayer for them; and
hoped that God would bow the heavens and
come down for their salvation. It seemed to me,
that there could be no impediment sufficient to
obstruct that glorious work, seeing the living
God, as I strongly hoped, was engaged for it. I
continued in a solemn frame, lifting up my heart
to God for assistance and grace, that I might be
more mortified to this present world, that my
whole soul might be taken up continually in concern
for the advancement of Christ&#8217;s kingdom.
Earnestly desired that God would purge me
more, that I might be a chosen vessel to bear his
name among the heathens. Continued in this
frame till I fell asleep.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> Why, he was much such a man as
Eliot.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Both Eliot and Brainerd did a great
deal of good among the Indians. The language<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
of Brainerd was, &#8220;Here am I, Lord, send me;
send me to the ends of the earth; send me to the
rough, the savage pagans of the wilderness; send
me from all that is called comfort on earth; send
me even to death itself, if it be but in thy service,
and to extend thy kingdom.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> I hardly know whether Eliot was the
best man, or Brainerd.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> They were very unlike in one thing;
for Eliot lived till he was eighty-six years old;
whereas Brainerd died in the thirtieth year of his
age. But though so young, it is said of him, by
a learned and good man, &#8220;The Life and Diary
of David Brainerd exhibits a perfect pattern of
the qualities which should distinguish the instructor
of rude and barbarous tribes; the most
invincible patience and self-denial, the profoundest
humility, exquisite prudence, indefatigable
industry, and such a devotedness to God, or
rather such an absorption of the whole soul in
zeal for the Divine glory and the salvation of
men, as is scarcely to be paralleled since the age
of the apostles.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> Then, he was as good a man as Eliot.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> You will read his life surely, after all
you have heard about the Indians, and will be surprised
at his great success among them. I will read
you an extract from a letter written in those days by
some Oneida chiefs, by which you will see that
the labours of these good men were not in vain.</p>

<p>&#8220;The holy word of Jesus has got place amongst
us, and advances. Many have lately forsaken
their sins, to appearance, and turned to God.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
There are some among us who are very stubborn
and strong; but Jesus is almighty, and has all
strength, and his holy word is very strong, too:
therefore we hope it will conquer and succeed
more and more. We say no more; only we ask
our fathers to pray for us, though they are at a
great distance. Perhaps, by-and-by, through the
strength and mercy of Jesus, we shall meet in his
kingdom above. Farewell.</p>

</ul>


<p><i>Austin.</i> Why, they were all three of them
chiefs!</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The speech made by the chief, Little
Turtle, at Baltimore, on his way to see the President
of the United States, will interest you. Some
Quakers, who saw him, told him that the habit
among his tribe of drinking rum prevented them
from doing them good.</p>

<p>&#8220;Brothers and friends&mdash;When your forefathers
first met on this island, your red brethren were
very numerous; but, since the introduction amongst
us of what you call spirituous liquors, and what
we think may justly be called poison, our numbers
are greatly diminished. It has destroyed a
great part of your red brethren.</p>

<p>&#8220;My friends and brothers&mdash;We plainly perceive
that you see the very evil which destroys your red
brethren. It is not an evil of our own making.
We have not placed it amongst ourselves; it is an
evil placed amongst us by the white people; we
look to them to remove it out of the country. We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
tell them, &#8216;Brethren, fetch us useful things: bring
us goods that will clothe us, our women, and our
children; and not this evil liquor, that destroys
our health, that destroys our reason, that destroys
our lives.&#8217; But all that we can say on this subject
is of no service, nor gives relief to your red
brethren.</p>

<p>&#8220;My friends and brothers&mdash;I rejoice to find that
you agree in opinion with us, and express an
anxiety to be, if possible, of service to us, in removing
this great evil out of our country; an
evil which has had so much room in it, and has
destroyed so many of our lives, that it causes our
young men to say, &#8216;We had better be at war with
the white people. This liquor, which they introduced
into our country, is more to be feared than
the gun or tomahawk.&#8217; There are more of us
dead since the treaty of Greeneville, than we lost
by the six years&#8217; war before. It is all owing to
the introduction of this liquor among us.</p>

<p>&#8220;Brothers&mdash;When our young men have been
out hunting, and are returning home loaded with
skins and furs, on their way, if it happens that
they come where this whiskey is deposited, the
white man who sells it tells them to take a little
drink. Some of them will say, &#8216;No; I do not
want it.&#8217; They go on till they come to another
house, where they find more of the same kind of
drink. It is there offered again; they refuse; and
again the third time: but, finally, the fourth or
fifth time, one accepts of it, and takes a drink,
and getting one he wants another, and then a
third, and fourth, till his senses have left him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
After his reason comes back to him, when he gets
up and finds where he is, he asks for his peltry.
The answer is, &#8216;You have drunk them.&#8217; &#8216;Where
is my gun?&#8217; &#8216;It is gone.&#8217; &#8216;Where is my blanket?&#8217;
&#8216;It is gone.&#8217; &#8216;Where is my shirt?&#8217; &#8216;You have
sold it for whiskey!&#8217; Now, brothers, figure to
yourselves what condition this man must be in.
He has a family at home; a wife and children
who stand in need of the profits of his hunting.
What must be their wants, when even he himself
is without a shirt?&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> There is a great deal of good sense
in what Little Turtle said.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The war between England and
America made sad confusion among the Indians,
and the missionaries too; for it was reported that
the missionaries were joining the French against
the English, so that they and the Indian converts
were dreadfully persecuted.</p>

<p>Colonel de Peyster, who was then the English
governor at Fort Detroit, suspected the Christian
Indians of being partisans of the Americans, and
the missionaries of being spies; and he wished
the Indians favourable to him to carry them all off.
Captain Pipe, a Delaware chief, persuaded the
half king of the Hurons to force them away. Persecution
went on, till the missionaries, seeing that
no other course remained, they being plundered
without mercy, and their lives threatened, consented
to emigrate. They were thus compelled
to quit their pleasant settlement, escorted by a
troop of savages headed by an English officer.
The half king of the Hurons went with them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
But I will read you an account of what took place
after they reached Sandusky Creek. &#8220;Having
arrived at Sandusky Creek, after a journey of upwards
of four weeks, the half king of the Hurons
and his warriors left them, and marched into their
own country, without giving them any particular
orders how to proceed. Thus they were abandoned
in a wilderness where there was neither
game nor provisions of any kind; such was the
place to which the barbarians had led them, notwithstanding
they had represented it as a perfect
paradise. After wandering to and fro for some
time, they resolved to spend the winter in Upper
Sandusky; and, having pitched on the most convenient
spot they could find in this dreary region,
they erected small huts of logs and bark, to
shelter themselves from the rain and cold. They
were now, however, so poor, that they had neither
beds nor blankets; for, on the journey, the savages
had stolen every thing from them, except only
their utensils for manufacturing maple sugar. But
nothing distressed them so much as the want of
provisions. Some had long spent their all, and
now depended on the charity of their neighbours
for a morsel to eat. Even the missionaries, who
hitherto had uniformly gained a livelihood by the
labour of their hands, were now reduced to the
necessity of receiving support from the congregation.
As their wants were so urgent, Shebosh
the missionary, and several of the Christian Indians,
returned, as soon as possible, to their settlements
on the Muskingum, to fetch the Indian corn
which they had left growing in the fields.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Scarcely had the congregation begun to settle
in Sandusky, when the missionaries were ordered
to go and appear before the governor of Fort Detroit.
Four of them, accompanied by several of
the Indian assistants, accordingly set off without
delay, while the other two remained with their
little flock. On taking their departure, they experienced
the most agonizing sensations: partly,
as they knew not what might be the issue of the
journey; and partly, as they were obliged to leave
their families in want of the common necessaries
of life. As they travelled chiefly by land, along
the banks of Lake Erie, they had to pass through
numerous swamps, over large inundated plains,
and through thick forests. But the most painful
circumstance was, their hearing that some of the
Indians, who had gone to Muskingum to fetch
corn, had been murdered by the white people;
and that a large body of these miscreants were
marching to Sandusky, to surprise the new settlement.
This report, indeed, was not correct. Shebosh,
the missionary, and five of the Christian
Indians were, it is true, taken prisoners at Shoenbrunn
and carried to Pittsburg. The others
returned safe to Sandusky, with about four hundred
bushels of Indian corn, which they had gathered
in the fields. But as the travellers did not hear
a correct statement of these circumstances until
afterwards, they suffered meanwhile the greatest
anxiety and distress.</p>

<p>&#8220;Having arrived at Detroit, they appeared before
the governor, in order to answer the accusations
brought against them, of holding a correspondence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
with the Americans, to the prejudice of
the English interest. The investigation, however,
was deferred till Captain Pipe, their principal accuser,
should arrive. A circumstance which could
not but give them much uneasiness, as he had
hitherto shown himself their bitter and determined
enemy. They had no friend on earth to interpose
in their behalf; but they had a Friend in heaven,
in whom they put their trust: nor was their confidence
in Him in vain. On the day of trial,
Captain Pipe, after some ceremonies had passed
between him and Colonel de Peyster, respecting
the scalps and prisoners which he had brought
from the United States, rose and addressed the
governor as follows:&mdash;&#8216;Father&mdash;You commanded
us to bring the believing Indians and their teachers
from the Muskingum. This has been done. When
we had brought them to Sandusky, you ordered
us to bring their teachers and some of their chiefs
unto you. Here you see them before you. Now
you may speak with them yourself, as you have
desired. But I hope you will speak good words
unto them: yea, I tell you, speak good words
unto them; for they are my friends, and I should
be sorry to see them ill used.&#8217; These last words
he repeated two or three times. In reply to this
speech, the governor enumerated the various complaints
he had made against the brethren, and
called upon him to prove that they had actually
corresponded with the Americans, to the prejudice
of the English. To this the chief replied,
that such a thing might have happened; but they
would do it no more, for they were now at Detroit.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
The governor, justly dissatisfied with this answer,
peremptorily demanded that he should give a direct
reply to his question. Pipe was now greatly embarrassed;
and, bending to his counsellors, asked
them what he should say. But they all hung
their heads in silence. On a sudden, however, he
rose, and thus addressed the governor:&mdash;&#8216;I said
before that such a thing might have happened;
now I will tell you the truth. The missionaries
are innocent. They have done nothing of themselves;
what they did, they were compelled to
do.&#8217; Then, smiting his breast, he added: &#8216;I am
to blame, and the chiefs who were with me. We
forced them to do it when they refused;&#8217; alluding
to the correspondence between the Delaware chiefs
and the Americans, of which the missionaries were
the innocent medium. Thus the brethren found
an advocate and a friend in their accuser and
enemy.</p>

<p>&#8220;After making some further inquiries, the governor
declared, before the whole camp, that the
brethren were innocent of all the charges alleged
against them; that he felt great satisfaction in their
endeavours to civilize and Christianize the Indians;
and that he would permit them to return
to their congregation without delay. He even
offered them the use of his own house, in the most
friendly manner; and as they had been plundered,
contrary to his express command, he ordered them
to be supplied with clothes, and various other
articles of which they stood in need. He even
bought the four watches which the savages had
taken from them and sold to a trader. After experiencing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
various other acts of kindness from him
they returned to Sandusky, and were received
with inexpressible joy by their families and the
whole congregation.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Well, I am glad it has all ended so happily.
Captain Pipe and Colonel de Peyster acted
an unworthy part, to suspect the missionaries.</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> They did; but the colonel declared before
the whole camp that they were innocent.
That was making some amends for his suspicions.</p>

<p><i>Basil.</i> Captain Pipe ought to have been ashamed
of himself.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The missionaries went through various
trials, and nearly a hundred Christian Indians&mdash;men,
women and children&mdash;were cruelly slaughtered;
but afterwards the missions began to wear a
more prosperous appearance. I have now kept
you longer than usual. The next time you come
here, I will finish my missionary account. Though
among the tribes near the whites great changes
have taken place, yet, among the Indians of the
far-west, their customs are but little altered. They
join in the buffalo hunt, assemble in the war-party,
engage in their accustomed games, and
smoke the pipe of peace, the same as ever.</p>

<p>In the former part of the hunter&#8217;s relation,
Austin Edwards and his brothers thought of little
else than of bluffs and prairies, buffaloes, bears
and beavers, warlike Indian chiefs and the spirit-stirring
adventures of savage life; but the last
visit paid to the cottage had considerably sobered
their views. The hunter had gradually won his
way into their affections, by contributing largely
to their amusement; and he had, also, secured
their respect and high opinion, by his serious remarks.
They had no doubt of his being a true
friend to Indians, and they had, on that account,
listened the more attentively to what he had advanced
on the subject of missionaries. The knowledge
that they were about to hear the end of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
hunter&#8217;s relation, though it hung a little heavy on
their spirits, disposed them to seriousness and attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; said the hunter, as soon as
Austin, Brian, and Basil had seated themselves
in his cottage, and requested him to continue his
missionary account, &#8220;I will give you the best
statement I can, in a few words, of the number
of people who are employed among the Indians
in the missionary cause.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Yes; we shall like to hear that very
well.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> The American Board of Commissioners
for Foreign Missions sustain missionary
stations among the Cherokees, Choctaws, Pawnees,
Oregon tribes, Sioux, Ojibbewas, Stockbridge tribe,
New York tribes and the Abenaquis. There are
twenty-five stations and twenty-three missionaries,
three medical missionaries, three native preachers,
two physicians, ten male and forty-five female
assistants.</p>

<p>The Board of Missions connected with the Presbyterian
church sustain missions among the
Creeks, the Iowas and Sacs, and the Chippeways
and Ottawas; three missionaries and their wives
and several teachers are employed.</p>

<p>The missionary society of the Methodist Episcopal
church have established missions among the
Shawnees, Delawares, Wyandotts, Kickapoos,
Pottawatomies, Choctaws, Chickasaws, Cherokees,
Senecas, Creeks, Oneidas, Winnebagoes and
some smaller tribes. From an old report of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
laborious society, 1844, I have copied a passage
which I will read you:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is now generally conceded, by those best acquainted
with the peculiarities of the Indian character,
that however powerful the gospel may be,
in itself, to melt and subdue the savage heart, it
is indispensable, if we would secure the fruits of
our missionary labours, to connect the blessings
of civilization with all our Christian efforts. And
we rejoice to learn, that among many of the Indian
tribes the civilizing process is going on, and
keeping pace with their spiritual advancement.
They are turning their attention more and more
to agriculture, and the various arts of civilized
life. They have also established a number of
schools and academies, some of which they have
liberally endowed from the annuities they receive
from the United States government. Some of these
schools are already in successful operation, and
many of the Indian youth are making rapid advancement
in literary pursuits.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Baptist Board of Missions have seven missions,
embracing nineteen stations and out-stations,
thirty-two missionaries and assistants, ten
native preachers and assistants, fifteen organized
churches and sixteen hundred professing Christians.
These missionary labours are among the
Ojibbewas, Ottowas, Tonewandas, Tuscaroras,
Shawnees, Cherokees, Creeks and Choctaws.</p>

<p>The United Brethren or Moravians, and the
Board of Missions of the Protestant Episcopal
church, also maintain missions among the Indians.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> How do the missionaries preach to the
Indians? Do they understand their strange language?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Your question calls to my mind one
of the most interesting and remarkable events of
Indian history. I will endeavour to give you a
brief account of it. I refer to the invention of an
alphabet by a native Cherokee named George
Guess or Guyst, who knew not how to speak English
and was never taught to read English books.
It was in 1824-5 that this invention began to
attract considerable attention. Having become
acquainted with the principle of the alphabet; viz.
that marks can be made the symbols of sound;
this uninstructed man conceived the notion that
he could express all the syllables in the Cherokee
language by separate marks, or characters. On
collecting all the syllables which, after long study
and trial, he could recall to his memory, he found
the number to be <i>eighty-two</i>. In order to express
these, he took the letters of our alphabet for a part
of them, and various modifications of our letters,
with some characters of his own invention, for the
rest. With these symbols he set about writing
letters; and very soon a correspondence was
actually maintained between the Cherokees in
Wills Valley, and their countrymen beyond the
Mississippi, 500 miles apart. This was done by
individuals who could not speak English, and
who had never learned any alphabet, except this
syllabic one, which Guess had invented, taught
to others, and introduced into practice. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
interest in this matter increased till, at length,
young Cherokees travelled a great distance to be
instructed in this easy method of writing and
reading. In three days they were able to commence
letter-writing, and return home to their
native villages prepared to teach others. Either
Guess himself, or some other person afterwards,
discovered <i>four</i> other syllables; making all the
known syllables of the Cherokee language <i>eighty-six</i>.
This is a very curious fact; especially when
it is considered that the language is very copious
on some subjects, a single verb undergoing some
thousands of inflections. All syllables in the
Cherokee language end with vowels. The same
is true of the language of the islanders of the Pacific
ocean. But in the Choctaw language, syllables
often end with consonants.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some months since,&#8221; says a report of the Cherokee
mission in 1825, &#8220;Mr. David Brown commenced
the translation of the New Testament into
Cherokee, with the occasional assistance of two
or three of his countrymen, who are more thoroughly
acquainted, than he is, with that language.
Already the four Gospels are translated, and fairly
copied; and if types and a press were ready, they
could be immediately revised and printed and
read. Extracts are now transcribed and perused
by a few.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is manifest that such a translation must be
very imperfect; but it is equally manifest that
much divine truth maybe communicated by it,
and probably with more accuracy than is commonly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
done by preaching, either with an interpreter,
or without one.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another account is a little more full:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is well worthy of notice, that Mr. Guyst,
the inventor, is a man past the middle age. He
had seen books, and, I have been told, had an
English spelling-book in his house; but he could
not read a word in any language, nor speak the
English language at all. His alphabet consists of
eighty-six characters, each of which represents a
syllable, with the exception of one, which has the
sound of the English <i>s</i>, and is prefixed to other
characters when required. These eighty-six characters
are sufficient to write the language, at least
intelligibly. The alphabet is thought by some
of the Cherokees to need improvement; but, as
it is, it is read by a very large portion of the
people, though I suppose there has been no such
thing as a school in which it has been taught, and
it is not more than two or three years since it was
invented. A few hours of instruction are sufficient
for a Cherokee to learn to read his own language
intelligibly. He will not, indeed, so soon
be able to read <i>fluently</i>: but when he has learned
to read and understand, fluency will be acquired
by practice. The extent of my information will
not enable me to form a probable estimate of the
number in the nation who can thus read, but I
am assured, by those who had the best opportunity
of knowing, that there is no part of the nation
where the new alphabet is not understood.
That it will prevail over every other method of
writing the language, there is no doubt.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> Did they find the language could be
easily written and printed?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> In 1828 one of the missionaries of
the American Board devoted himself to the acquisition
of the language, with a view to translating
the Scriptures, and preparing school-books and
tracts for the general instruction of the people.
As he proceeded in the study of the language, he
found it more and more wonderful in its structure,
and the difficulties which must have attended the
labour of reducing it to a system became more
and more apparent.</p>

<p>Before this, however, the enthusiasm of the
people was kindled: great numbers had learned
to read; they were circulating hymns and portions
of Scripture, and writing letters every day, and
even procured a medal to present to the inventor,
as a token of their gratitude for this wonderful
method of writing their own language. They
began to talk much of printing in the new and
famous characters; appropriated money to procure
a press and types, and anticipated with joy the
printing of the Scriptures in a language they
could read and understand.</p>

<p>At the same time the missionaries to the Choctaws
were reducing their language to a system.
One of them collected more than 3000 words,
arranged according to the subjects to which
they refer, which he translated into English.
Ten hymns were also translated into Choctaw,
and a spelling-book prepared in the same
language.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> But let us hear what became of the
Guyst&#8217;s Cherokee alphabet. As that was an
invention of his own, it seems very wonderful.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> I will tell you. In the summer or
fall of 1827, there was an examination of one of
the Cherokee mission schools, on which occasion
one of the chiefs made an address in the Cherokee
language, of which the following is a translation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear children:&mdash;I often speak to you, and
encourage you to continue in the pursuit of useful
knowledge; such knowledge as will be for your
own good, and that of your own country. You
are engaged in a good thing. I am always pleased
to see the progress you are making in learning.
I feel that much depends on you. On you depends
the future welfare of your country.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I was young there were no schools
among us. No one to teach us such learning as
you are now obtaining. My lot was quite different
from yours. You have here many advantages.
Improve them. Pursue the paths of virtue and
knowledge. Some of your fathers, who first
agreed for the teachers to come among us, are
now no more. They are gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is now some years since a school was
established in Creekpath, your native place. I
myself aided to build the first school-house. At
first the children did not learn very fast. But now,
since the establishment of a school at this place,
they are doing much better. I have reason to
believe you are learning as fast as might be expected.
Some of you have been in school five<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
years, and some not so long. You have now
acquired considerable knowledge. By-and-by
you will have more. This gives me great satisfaction.
Remember that the whites are near us.
With them we have constant intercourse; and
you must be sensible that, unless you can speak
their language, read and write as they do, they
will be able to cheat you and trample upon your
rights. Be diligent, therefore, in your studies,
and let nothing hinder you from them. Do not
quarrel with each other. Aid one another in your
useful employ; obey your teachers, and walk in
the way they tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>In November, after this speech was delivered,
a fount of types in the new Cherokee alphabet
was shipped from Boston to the Cherokee nation:
and from an account published at the time, I take
a few sentences.</p>

<p>&#8220;The press will be employed in printing the
New Testament and other portions of the Bible,
and school-books in the Cherokee language, and
such other books in Cherokee or English as will
tend to diffuse knowledge through the nation.
A prospectus has also been issued for a newspaper,
entitled the <i>Cherokee Ph&#339;nix</i>, to be printed
partly in Cherokee, and partly in English; the
first number of which is expected to appear early
in January. All this has been done by order of
the Cherokee government, and at their expense.
They have also hired a printer to superintend the
printing office, to whom they give $400 a year,
and another printer to whom they give $300.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
Mr. Elias Boudinot, who was educated, in part,
at the Foreign Mission School, then established
in Cornwall, (Conn.,) was appointed editor, with
a yearly salary of $300.</p>

<p>&#8220;Among the Cherokees, then, we are to see the
first printing-press ever owned and employed by any
nation of the aborigines of this continent; the first
effort at writing and printing in characters of their
own; the first newspaper, and the first book
printed among themselves; the first editor; and
the first well organized system for securing a
general diffusion of knowledge among the people.
Among the Cherokees, also, we see established
the first regularly elective government, with the
legislative, judicial, and executive branches distinct;
with the safeguards of a written constitution
and trial by jury. Here, also, we see first
the Christian religion recognised and protected by
the government; regular and exemplary Christian
churches; and flourishing schools extensively
established, and, in many instances, taught by
native Cherokees.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Brian.</i> I suppose, by this time, they have a
great many books printed, and more than one
newspaper.</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> Alas, poor fellows! they have had
something very different to think about since the
times I have been speaking of. I cannot make
you understand all the particulars. But the
government of the state within whose bounds the
Indian country lay, wished to have the Indians
under their control; while the Indians considered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
themselves, and had always been treated by the
United States government as independent nations
or communities. Treaties were made with them
just as with foreign nations. There were difficulties
on every side. A proposition was made
to them, to sell their lands to the United States,
and remove to a country beyond the Mississippi.
Some of the tribes were in favour of this, and
some were opposed to it. The state government
became more and more urgent for their removal,
and at last effectual measures were adopted for
this purpose, and the Cherokees and other tribes
were driven from their homes, which were now
becoming the abodes of civilization and comfort
and Christian love, and were compelled to find a
new residence in the far, far distant West. It is a
melancholy and reproachful chapter in our history
as a nation; and we have reason to fear that a
day of retribution is at hand, if, indeed, it is not
now upon us. There is a just God, who plucks
up and destroys even the mighty nations of the
earth; and, in every period of the world, his
power to visit their iniquities has been exhibited.</p>

<p><i>Austin.</i> And have all efforts for their improvement
been given up?</p>

<p><i>Hunter.</i> O, no. As I told you just now,
several interesting and prosperous missions are
established among them in their new abode; and
so lately as the years 1843-4, the sum of $300
was appropriated by the American Bible Society,
towards printing portions of the New Testament
in the Dakota tongue, for the use of the Sioux.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
And the same blessed volume is now in the
course of publication at the Bible Society&#8217;s house
in New York, in the language of the Ojibbewas.
This is a large tribe, and their tongue is understood
by several of the neighbouring tribes. It
is hoped that the possession of the gospel of
peace by the Sioux and Ojibbewas, in their respective
tongues, will produce a more pacific
spirit between these two hostile tribes. To this
end Christians should pray that the Scriptures of
truth may be accompanied by the Spirit of truth;
that they may bring forth the fruits of holiness;
and that the remnant of the tribes may all be
brought to the knowledge of the Saviour.</p>

<p>There are many obstacles to this most desirable
event. The wars that break out unexpectedly
among the tribes, the reverence entertained for
superstitious customs, their removals from one
place to another, the natural indolence of Indians,
and their love of spirituous liquors, given by white
men in order to deceive them; these and other
causes are always at work, operating against the
efforts of the missionary. I might, it is true, give
you more instances than I have done of an encouraging
kind, respecting the Indians generally.<a name="FNanchor_6_12" id="FNanchor_6_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_12" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_12" id="Footnote_6_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_12"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> The reader is referred to a memoir of <span class="smcap">Catharine
Brown</span>, a converted Cherokee girl, (written by the Rev.
Dr. <span class="smcap">Anderson</span>, and published by the <i>American Sunday-school
Union</i>,) for one of the most interesting exhibitions
of the influence of the Gospel upon the human heart, as
well as for a very correct and gratifying account of missionary
labour and success among untutored Indians.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p></div>

<p>But, perhaps, it will be better now to sum up the
account by saying, the missionary is at work
among them with some degree of success; and
though, from the remoteness of many of the
tribes, their strong attachment to the superstitions
of their forefathers, and other causes already
alluded to, the progress of Christianity is necessarily
slow, there is no doubt that it will ultimately
prevail; the promise has gone forth, and will be
fulfilled; the heathen will be the inheritance of
the Redeemer, and the uttermost parts of the earth
will be his possession. He who has clothed the
arm of the red man with strength, shod his feet
with swiftness, and filled his heart with courage,
will, in due time, subdue his cruelty and revenge;
open his eyes to discern the wondrous things of
God&#8217;s holy law; dispose his mind to acknowledge
the Lord of life and glory, and make him willing
to receive the gospel of the Redeemer.</p>
